<p>This sample takes the following data (you need to have a HR ERP supports such data capture!), and turns it into a full Employee Inventory Salary Table. In this example, the final data table (after any necessary cross-joining) is created entirely with DAX (here, ETL, and ‘M’ code are not used).</p>

<p>The example in this article is slightly more complex than the Tenure example shown in this <em>DAX article:</em> <a href="../dax-samples/hr-inventory-table-and-tenure.html"><strong>HR - Showing Inventory Movements &amp; analysing Total Running Tenure over time</strong></a>, to calculate Tenure. That example shows: (a) each Employee’s Running Tenure (in Years) by Month - showing only one figure for a user, in a given Month. It also shows (b) each Employee’s Running Tenure (in Months) by Job Grade, and Month - again, showing only one figure for a user, for a given Month and Job Grade.</p>

<p>The way Running Tenure is calculated, to all intents and purposes <em>good enough</em>, and we can get by, without having to be <strong><em>Hyper-Accurate!</em></strong></p>

<p>In this example, however, we take things a step further. Probably the most difficult measure shown in this report is:</p>

<p>(i) <strong>Running Average Monthly Salary by Grade:</strong> (shown on page 2 of the report).</p>

<p>The measure is re-computed <strong><em>everytime</em></strong> a user’s profile changes - even if looking at the same month, where the user’s job grade <strong>does not</strong> change - for example, if there are other profile changes, such as in their: Department, Country, Full or Part Time working status, <em>over the course</em> of the month.</p>

<h3 id="running-average-monthly-salary-methodology">Running Average Monthly Salary Methodology</h3>

<p>The Running Average Monthly Salary calculation is complex (but also as accurate as I could make it!). For each Employee, the measure is computed, by Job Grade, by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Taking the Arithmetic average of: (i) the Weighted Average salary of the Employee in the current month (upto the end date of current profile change), together with (ii) the sum of the Weighted Average salary of the Employee in each of the previous months, as they stood at the end of those months (but still considering only those months where the Employee held the same Job Grade - as the measure is computed at a Job Grade level),</li>
  <li>The Weighted Average Monthly Salary, upto a particular date, itself, is also re-computed for each profile change, and calculated by taking a blended average of the Employee’s Pro-Rated (Full Month) Salaries, for each unique profile position held by the Employee in the given month (i.e. from the start of the month (or first start date at that particular job grade, which ever is later) upto the given end date of the profile the Weighted Average Salary is being calculated for).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="worked-example">Worked Example</h3>

<p>To illustrate the method more clearly:</p>

<p>If, in January, Employee 001, worked 5 days, as an Associate, in Brazil, from 27/01/2020 to 31/01/2020, on a Pro-Rated Monthly Salary of £5,000, the Weighted Average Salary on 31/01/2020 is: £5,000/5 * 5 = £5,000. Their Running Average Monthly Salary would be £5,000 / 1 = £5,000 (Note here, if the employee just started on 27/01/2020, their actual paid salary would be: £5,000 * 5 / 31 = £806, in the Month)</p>

<p>If Employee 001 then worked for another 10 days, from 01/02/2020 to 10/02/2020, on a Pro-Rated Monthly Salary of £6,000, their Weighted Average Salary on 10/02/2020 would be: £6,000/10 * 10 = £6,000. Their Running Average Salary, upto this date, would be: ( £5,000 (from Jan) + £6,000 (from Feb) ) / 2 = £5,500</p>

<p>If then, the Employee then worked for 15 days, from 11/02/2020 to 25/02/2020, on a Pro-Rated Monthly Salary of £5,000, their Weighted Average Salary on 25/02/2020 would be: (£6,000 * 10 + £5,000 * 15) / 25 = £5,400. Their Running Average Monthly Salary would change to: ( £5,000 (from Jan) + £5,400 (from Feb) ) / 2 = £5,200</p>

<h3 id="other-measures">Other Measures</h3>

<p>Apart from <strong>Running Average Monthly Salary by Grade</strong>, the report also shows:</p>

<p>(iii) The <strong>Actual Salary Paid to each Employee:</strong>, by Job Grade, and Month, both as a Matrix Table, and Stacked Bar Chart (on page 1)<br />
(ii) The <strong>Actual Salary Paid to each Employee:</strong>, by Country, Department, Part of Full time working status, and Job Grade (on page 2)</p>

<h3 id="enhancements">Enhancements</h3>

<p>Other enhancements to make the calculation more accurate, have been to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ignore the affect of Weekends in any day count calculations (when computing any <em>Weighted Average</em>, <em>Actual Paid</em>, or <em>Pro-Rated</em> Salaries)</li>
  <li>Reduce the <strong>Weighted Average Salary</strong> calculation, for any Working days not worked in the month
    <ul>
      <li>For example, assuming weekends don’t exist, if an Employee worked from 01/02/2020 to 10/02/2020, and then from 15/02/2020 to 20/02/2020, the Days in Service worked by the Employee would be 16. The Days Available to that Employee in the Month would be 20 (because of the 4 days not worked). The affect would be to reduce their Weighted Average Salary when it is calculated on 20/02/2022. There would be no affect when the salary is calculated on 10/02/2020, because at this point, both Days in Service, and Days Available would have been 10)</li>
      <li>Note that, if the Employee started working slightly later, say on 03/02/2020 (i.e. not the first day of the month), to 10/02/2020, and then again from 15/02/2020 to 20/02/2020, their total Days in Service on 20/02/2020 would be 14, and Days Available would be 18. Again, provided 03/02/2020 was Employee’s very first day working at the particular Job Grade, the Weighted Average Salary when calculated at 10/02/2020 would not be affected. It would still though be affected when calculated on 20/02/2020.</li>
    </ul>

By comparison, the Running Tenure example, shown in this <em>DAX article:</em> <a href="../dax-samples/hr-inventory-table-and-tenure.html"><strong>HR - Showing Inventory Movements &amp; analysing Total Running Tenure over time</strong></a>, takes a much simpler approach. Each Employee’s tenure (Tenure by employee, or Tenure by employee by job grade), is calculated by providing one running total figure - even if different profile statuses are held by the employee in the same month, at the same job grade. The calculation is done by scanning the entire month first to compute the running total figure for the entire month, rather than, what is being done above, where the running total is re-calculated for each profile change, <em>within the course</em> of the month.)</p>

<h2 id="model-extensions">Model Extensions</h2>

<p>Possible extensions to this model, could include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding ‘<strong><em>Freelance or Permanent</em></strong>’ as an extra field to distinguish between these staff types</li>
  <li>Separating the calculations for <em>Freelancers</em> and <em>Permanent Staff</em> so that the so that the <strong>Running Salary</strong> and <strong>Weighted Average Salary</strong> calculations only consider the time when a person was a <em>Freelancer</em>, or only when they were <em>Permanent Staff</em>, or both.</li>
  <li>Freelance records could be automatically linked and created from their agency Timesheet submissions.</li>
  <li>Consideration of Public Holidays</li>
</ul>
