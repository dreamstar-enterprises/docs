<h2 id="interview">Interview</h2>

<p>I was really fascinated by an interview I saw recently between Sudeshna Sen, from the organisation, Abundance Psyche, and David Lancefield, ex-Partner of the Professional Services firm, PwC (the first company I had worked for after graduating from college).</p>

<p>David worked in various departments in the firm, but left from its ‘Strategy&amp;’ division, at age 46, having had what appears to have been a very rewarding and successful 24 years, leading more than 500 projects, working with over 35 CEOs, and structuring 15 digital ventures, with clients that have ranged from the BBC, Vodafone to the NHS. He is also a regular contributor to magazines and newspapers such as the FT, Forbes and HBR.</p>

<p>This interview was quite a wide-ranging conversation, but it was interesting to learn about what David’s views were on certain topics, both before and after he left the firm, including: paradoxes he is fascinated by; why he thinks people are sometimes fearful of bringing their whole true self to work; the importance of working in a psychologically safe environment; how he juggles his work and home commitments; what he thinks good business strategy today means; how people have reacted to the news of his resignation as a mid-tenure Partner; how he has since transitioned to becoming an executive coach; how he thinks people can build a better networks of sponsors, mentors and collaborators in their career; what people can do to better take charge of their career; and how he has been finding things outside of corporate life.</p>

<p>I have summarised the key findings of Sudeshna’s and David’s conversation below. It is an interview I have no doubt many people would be able to learn something from!</p>

<h2 id="paradoxes">Paradoxes!</h2>

<p>Paradoxes reflect what real life is about! We often hear, read, or see fake dogmatic views that leaders have to do a particular thing, or that everything should be all about “tech”, or that it should all be about our professional lives. But, actually, it is never quite as simple as this!</p>

<p>In reality, there will always be interactions, trade-offs, and tensions at play. For example, you might hear about leaders delivering amazing results, about growing a company’s share price, improving its profitability, or strengthening its brand, and all these other great things. For many leaders, however, this can leave a trail of collateral damage - on either their own health, their own sanity, or of those around them.</p>

<p>Often people only see and hear one side of the story, when often there is another one to tell - a more personal one! So, success and impact should often be thought of in both a professional sense and personal sense!
 </p>
<h2 id="bringing-ones-whole-true-self-to-work-and-a-creating-psychologically-safe-environment">Bringing ones whole true self to work and a creating psychologically safe environment</h2>

<p>Bringing everyone’s best self, and best interests, styles and backgrounds to work, can help create a much better work environment!</p>

<p>If people go on to put on a mask at work, or do things that aren’t their true selves, then things can become boring really, really quickly, and it will also all feel a bit inauthentic.</p>

<p>Many people have rich, stimulating, and varied experiences outside work – with very positive hobbies, and passions, and bringing some of these attributes and skills into work can really help create a positive working environment.</p>

<p>But some people don’t do this because they don’t feel psychologically safe to do so. Sometimes this is because people aren’t interested in doing this, other times it is because others only see people as a performance stat, or number on a page.</p>

<p>Sharing personal stories at work helps here as it not only helps to encourage others to do the same, but also help others learn some new lessons from that experience.</p>

<h2 id="why-people-might-not-share-their-true-selves-at-work">Why people might not share their true selves at work</h2>

<p>This can sometimes happen if people haven’t seen others who are similar to them. It particularly happens to those early on, or those who are in a minority group. They find it risky sharing something about themselves that others may not understand. And if they are trying to make an impression, and still trying to get to know somebody, then why take that risk?</p>

<p>Sometimes the argument can be that people can be just so focussed on what their day job is, that they will only be focussed on the task at hand.</p>

<p>It can also be that somebody else is not making it safe for them to do so. Others might see it as a distraction. They might say, “<em>well, hang on, I’ve asked you to do this. Your role is this in this team. Why are you going into other areas that aren’t relevant?</em>”</p>

<p>At a very human level – we should probably all be interested in each other?</p>

<p>Also a fact of life is that people face pressure, and this is true of any role, but particularly Senior roles, but when people are under a lot of pressure, sometimes they can feel insecure themselves. They can tend to shrink, or become very narrow, and only focus on what’s ahead of them. Anything that’s outside that realm can feel difficult and risky. So, people can tend to just focus on what’s in front of them, and often, most of the time, it is to their detriment.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-people-into-your-leadership-team">Bringing People into your Leadership Team</h2>

<p>If you’re a manager of a group or a leader of a particular functional area, what’s important is how you invite people in, how you share what is relevant, and how you frame your conversations.</p>

<p>Often, when we share our stories, our backstory, our background, people think it has to be some big thing. You know, you get up on a stage and you tell your story. There are plenty of examples of people doing that, even though it can feel a bit daunting.</p>

<p>Its better if leaders say to people: “<em>right, we’re looking at this task, this problem, we want to come up with a new idea. Let’s all think of all the best possible ideas, wherever they come from</em>” - if this happens, then people might just share something anecdotal, a little nugget of their personal self, which could be quite small - but still very useful.</p>

<p>And when one person does this, it can open up the door for other people to share a little chunk, a little something of their own selves. Then you can delve deeper, and can build things up and up from there.</p>

<p>What can often be less effective is saying - “<em>Right, you’ve got 10 minutes, here is the floor. Tell us about where you come from, what you’re doing in your personal life</em>”, and so on. If you frame it this way, this is something that most people may not want to do.</p>

<p>Having curiosity is also important. Leaders, rather than assuming something about others because of their title, their seniority, their background, their education, and thinking they are are an x, y or z type of person, it’s always better to ask questions before making any assumptions.</p>

<p>Listening properly gives people space to express themselves the way they want to. Also thinking and putting bullet points down on paper might help, but that’s not always how people want to speak. People should be given the time and space to express themselves in different ways.</p>

<p>Lastly, investing time in other people is not a waste. It is not a distraction from getting to from A to B or delivering a target. It is an investment in a relationship. It is an investment in a person that will likely pay back dividends.</p>

<h2 id="good-business-strategy-today">Good Business Strategy today</h2>

<p>Yes, Business Strategy can be quite logical, structured, and analytical, but the great strategy isn’t just that. A great strategy is about choices - making choices, finding differentiated positions, and creating a very capable organisation. It should be creative, and it should be intuitive.</p>

<p>Strategy is about moving people to a new place that requires understanding the brain, what people’s feelings are, what the biases are, and giving a structured view about where an organization can move to.</p>

<p>Often people think of strategy as something defined by a series of Spreadsheets and PowerPoints, when actually it is much more than that.</p>

<p>Good strategy also needs substantiation. It needs evidence to support a perspective about how you can create a winning position in an area.</p>

<p>One of the things that strategists, whether they’re consultants or in-house strategists get wrong, is that they think they can do it on their own. But great strategy includes different perspectives: for people who are in the front of finance, how do you finance a strategy? How do you make it happen operationally, etc.?</p>

<p>Great strategists are also convenors. They are more architects than experts. They bring people together, and play the role of bringing everyone’s insights together so they can work out an idea, a plan and the momentum to actually make it happen.</p>

<p>Most strategies don’t work right. Most strategies just don’t work at all. A large part of this is because people haven’t got a clear strategy to start off with, they haven’t made some clear choices, and/or people don’t understand it.</p>

<p>The execution often also goes wrong. Strategy can often be developed by a small team at the top, either in the organization, or by external consultants who push it to the organization, who then say “get on and do it”. Most people look at it, and hear it, and think, “<em>Actually, I don’t quite know what I have been asked to do. I don’t quite know why I’ve been asked to do things differently. And by the way, what’s in it for me?</em>”</p>

<h2 id="career-moves">Career Moves</h2>

<p>People often go to where they are interested, and where they think the demand for work will be in the future. People will often go with questions like: “<em>What are people buying from me, both my colleagues and clients? What is hot in the market right now?</em>”. Sometimes that works, but sometimes it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Also people aren’t always focused purely on making money – if what they are being asked to do isn’t congruent with their interests, or themselves. People go for what stimulates them, and what gives them a lift, and energizes them.</p>

<h2 id="managing-time">Managing Time</h2>

<p>This is all about making choices day to day, about where you spend your time, with whom, and also about what you stop doing.</p>

<p>For example, how do you make sure that you keep moving on. Sometimes people just spend their time in meetings or calls all day. And they can sometimes be in the previous call in the next meeting. If people get better at compartmentalising from one activity or task to another, they’ll get those things done quicker, will be more focused, and will be better at moving on.</p>

<p>People also need to know when to say enough is enough.</p>

<h2 id="executive-coaching">Executive Coaching</h2>

<p>Coaching is often about spending a lot of time with somebody, beyond just helping them indirectly with the task at hand on a particular project. High-quality coaching is something that can draw out an answer, an idea, and solution from an individual, but also encourage them to think different.</p>

<p>They can be directive but also sometimes be non-directive. But people who are given a problem, go away and do the work, and then push it back to you, that is clearly not right.</p>

<p>Coaches are often also interested in the psyche of people, how they are thinking, why are they thinking a particular way? What they are like, when the coach go away? Coaches are often fascinated with these kinds of behavioural changes.</p>

<h2 id="peoples-reactions-to-the-news-of-resignations">Peoples reactions to the news of resignations</h2>

<p>People often leave a role or organisation because they want to try some new things in life. They might see various paths in a company that are fine. But fine may not be good enough for them. They might instead want to try and build a portfolio of different activities.</p>

<p>Some people might say to the person leaving “<em>You’re very courageous.</em>” Younger people might say, “<em>Of course, you’re going to try something new, why wouldn’t you? Why have you stayed so long?</em>” Other people might think “<em>So you’ve got a job, you’ve got a good role, a good title, are relatively well paid. Why would you give that up, to do something where you don’t have a big brand behind you and are not proven in all those areas.</em>”</p>

<p>When people leave an organization, by the time they tell others, they very likely will have gone through some kind of thought process for quite a long time, as there are often some very hard, very practical decisions that need to be made, with all the pros and cons carefully weighed up.</p>

<p>Before deciding, these people may reach out to other people on a private basis. People they know to have a different background, different mindset, in order to test and challenge their decision.</p>

<p>People often aren’t looking for an answer when they do this. They are often looking for how others think of how sound their reasoning is, or of how positively they come across, or of how much their eyes light up when they talk, however vaguely, or slightly incompletely, about the ideas and paths they wish to pursue. All these things together can say a lot!</p>

<p>People often also leave because they love the freedom just to make their own decisions, without going to a committee, or something similar. They can just go ahead and do it.</p>

<h2 id="working-as-a-solopreneur">Working as a solopreneur</h2>

<p>People like working more independently because it gives them the opportunity to shape their own and develop their own brand and platform.</p>

<p>People often learn a huge amount, a massive amount of stuff when running a business, some which is interesting, but some of which is a bit tedious.</p>

<p>Another thing is that if people are going to interview somebody, or going to write something up, and it has their personal name on it, it can matter to them a bit more than if they had been working in a large organisation. So they will put more effort in, as it is important for them to always be on their ‘A’ game.</p>

<p>Building a new network of people that can also serve them well, whether it’s potential clients, collaborators, or suppliers that can help with marketing are also all important when working as a solopreneur.</p>

<p>One downside is that there is often a lot of support that people get in a corporate that they don’t get when working by themselves. People might often ask - “<em>Where is everyone? Where have they gone?</em>” In a large company, if people have a problem or an idea, within one or two calls/emails they can usually get somebody pretty good to help them with it. Working alone, they have to be more resourceful with their existing network. They have to reach out to somebody who may be new, and make more choices and day to day micro-decisions that they don’t need to worry about making in a large company environment.</p>

<h2 id="mentors-and-mentorship">Mentors and Mentorship</h2>

<p>People often want to work with a range of people, because they want to keep things fresh and have a range of perspectives, such as working with younger, less experienced people, who they think are very high potential or just fascinating people.</p>

<p>Mentorship doesn’t have to happen at a certain point in one’s career, it can start whenever people want it to, whether they are coming out of an apprenticeship or university, or wherever else people might be coming from.</p>

<p>People will always have a range of people in their network, who have different skills, backgrounds, and mindsets from themselves that they can learn from.</p>

<p>Some people might think they’re all similar. But actually, if they delve a bit deeper, there will always be somebody who may be a bit more analytical than them, or somebody who may have done a slightly different internship to them.</p>

<p>People in a professional services firm, for example, maybe different to those working in a large company or a bank.</p>

<p>So, if people spend the time mapping out their network of people, and map them out through a number of different dimensions, then it is easier for them to say, “<em>Who can help me the most, in terms of giving me different views from the ones I could generate myself?</em>”</p>

<p>Of course, if people think they already know the answer, they probably won’t ask other people. For example, they might have a few friends, who might even be good friends, but who they don’t really consult that much. This is not because they don’t care about them, but because they believe that if they wrote down what they thought their friends were going to say, they would probably get about 80% of it right.</p>

<p>Sometimes it can also be quite good to have others around you who make you feel a little bit uncomfortable - because they might not think in the same way as you do, and because they can come up with novel ideas, and can challenge you a bit more.</p>

<p>And also brainstorming doesn’t have to take days or weeks - sometimes people can get the best ideas from five or 10 minutes of thought.</p>

<h2 id="very-talented-people">Very talented people</h2>

<p>Sometimes very talented people can just focus on themselves. But very talented, high performing people can also have just tunnel vision, because they are so obsessed about themselves that they will just progress, progress, and progress.</p>

<p>But they can have difficult moments too, or times when things that don’t quite go their way, for example, if the company they are in just doesn’t perform, even though they may have performed individually very well themselves. A lot of people have been let go because the company itself has not done very well.</p>

<p>This can be really difficult for these people because they haven’t got a network of people around them - and this is partly because they’ve been so focused on me, me, me. So, it’s important for people to “<em>Look around themselves, and invest in their relationships, even when they’re doing very well. They should take some time out, not only to think of new ideas, but just to breathe</em>”.</p>

<p>Another thing is that when people are too focused or too passionate about what they do, because they either look very physically serious, or are very heads down, this can make other people feel like, “<em>they’re too busy</em>”, or think that “<em>that person has got it sorted, and doesn’t need others to come and help them</em>”.</p>

<p>But what these focused and passionate people are unconsciously actually doing, is turning these other people away, who might have been able to help, or want to collaborate with them.</p>

<p>There is something about lifting your head up and looking around, going for a walk, and spending time. It’s not wasteful. It’s not wasteful time at all. It’s actually good time.</p>

<p>Environments at work should be created where people can feel calm, and relaxed, so they can think clearly. There needs to be a move away from an obsession with velocity, pressure, intensity and process.</p>

<h2 id="meetings--listening-to-others">Meetings &amp; listening to others</h2>

<p>In meetings people should be kind to the listener, which means people shouldn’t drone on. Secondly, when people listen to the person next to them, irrespective of who they are, or what their respective positions are, they should listen intently, which means eye contact, (though in some cultures this can be a bit more difficult to do). It also means no interruptions.</p>

<p>When people do this, they start working together better, because there is more mutual interest and mutual respect. This can also make the meetings less intense, more calm, and more thoughtful. Not every meeting necessarily needs to be like this - there are some meetings that can be transactional and quite operationally-focused.</p>

<p>Also, high performance is not always about velocity, intensity, stress and pressure. Very few people deliver better results when they’re anxious. So, instead of telling people “<em>we’re going to put more pressure on you to achieve better results</em>” it can be much better to reframe the conversation and say, “<em>What I want to do is set a really high ambition for this group. And I want to do that together. I believe in all of you. And I want to have a conversation about how we can work together</em>”. This can often set a much more positive dynamic.</p>

<p>Also, if people dominate proceedings, it often means that other people don’t participate. So people really need to rewire how they think of what high performance at work really is!</p>

<p>People should also all share with others about how they work best. And how they think differently. This can come down to either courage people have in a meeting, or privately between meetings. For example, people might say “<em>I work best when I’m thinking reflectively, or I work best when I’m the person who’s the Energizer, and so on</em>”.</p>

<p>What this does is help stop or reduce the number of assumptions people make about each other, about not being engaged, not being interested, or not having any good ideas. Because sometimes people can fall into the trap of thinking, the person who is the loud, big character, is actually the most impactful. They definitely play a role in terms of bringing the room up, lifting the mood, getting people thinking and so on - that plays a role. But this is only one role. There are lots of other roles people can play from: being a catalyst with ideas, being somebody who can convene people, or someone who can bring people together, somebody who can think alternative angles.</p>

<p>Often also, people default into a single character in meetings, particularly in traditional organizations. This leads to groupthink, with lots of “<em>mini-mes</em>”, and a lack of diversity of thought. When this happens, often what this needs is either the manager or the leader of that group to talk about how various people want to work, and actually show this curiosity. Or it needs somebody brave, outside the company, coming into the organization.</p>

<p>Also, when a lot of people are talking over each other on the phone in a meeting, somebody who says, “<em>Can I just intervene? We can’t hear each other speak. We’re not making any progress. I’m sensing this in disagreement. Can we talk about what the main areas of disagreement are?</em>” this can really change the dynamics of the conversation. They may say, okay, the main areas of disagreement are a, b, c, then they’re done, and have found a way through it.</p>

<p>No one person has all the answers? Some people have a bit more experience than others. What many people enjoy from their careers is a passion to learn, and having a touch of humility to say, “<em>I don’t really know the answer, perhaps you do</em>”, and actually showing that they care about not only the people around them, as human beings, but also about the result that they are trying to go for.</p>

<h2 id="paradoxes-re-visted">Paradoxes re-visted!</h2>

<p>Going back to paradoxes, sometimes people think that showing deep care and appreciation for other people can be an excuse to not really push the boundaries, because a person doesn’t want to offend them.</p>

<p>The paradox here is that people can be incredibly successful, but still care for people. Take the example of James Timpson, of Timpson’s, the shoe cobbler. He is the son of the founder. And he is known for his care of for his people - not only the fact that a proportion of his workforce are ex-offenders from prison, but also the fact that he knows there are certain perks and benefits that perhaps other organizations don’t give.</p>

<p>So, for example, if people have a bereavement, they can take holiday, and they support them with that, and so on. But he’s very clear that you have to earn this right. So, for example, the standards they’ve set for their stores, how people dress, and how they perform, are very, very high. And he’s very clear that the only reason he can be generous with those perks and how he looks after his people, is partly obviously his mindset, his beliefs, but also, because of the fact they make money. So, he was a benevolent person, he was good of his heart, but he also has really high standards.</p>

<p>So if people could match them, and know they could deliver against targets, then they get the benefits. If they didn’t, they were supported through difficult times over the store in the shops not working. But if it didn’t work, they were invited to leave. So that’s another example of a paradox where people can all show a lot more care for each other, whilst also trying to strive for their absolute best.</p>

<p>People striving for their absolute best can also mean at times, that there will be difficult moments. There will be things they have to call out when somebody is doing something right or wrong, and it will feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, a client might go as far as saying  “<em>Unless there is an element of grit between us. We’re not trying hard enough. Whenever we become really, really comfortable with each other, it’s probably enjoyable. But actually, we’re not really pushing things on.</em>”</p>
