<p>Inspired by the thoughts and views of people I respect and greatly admire - I spent some time this week reflecting on the past few years, thinking about the next few years, and wondering where life’s next new exciting adventures might take me!</p>

<p>Written in the form of a series of interviewer and interviewee questions, I start with that great question - “<em>life achievements</em>”!</p>

<h2 id="question-1">Question 1</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q1. Some people might say you have achieved a lot in your life so far?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A1.</em></strong> It’s always nice to be told that, but I think many people have achieved many things, and that what you achieve and how you see those achievements, depend a lot on your circumstances, your situation, and own perspective. I think what’s important to consider are not just your tangible achievements, but the many other intangible things you achieve too. Moreover, it may be that you achieve one thing very well, rather than many things to a mediocre level. So when it comes to thinking about people’s achievements, there are many things to consider!</p>

<h2 id="question-2">Question 2</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q2. You performed quite well when you were young at school. Were you always top of your class?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A2.</em></strong> Certainly not. Through my school years, I was very strong at Maths and the Sciences, but relatively weak, for example, in some of the Humanities and Arts subjects, such as English Literature, History, and The Classics.</p>

<p>But, now “<strong><em>Leadership</em></strong>” and “<strong><em>Communication</em></strong>” are things I have become more and more passionate about, so I am not “as strong” on the mathematical and technical dimensions as I used to be. Over recent years, I’ve just had much more of a passion for speaking and communicating. It is something I feel I needed to work more on.</p>

<h2 id="question-3">Question 3</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q3. What are the key skills you took away from your schooling days?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A3.</em></strong> For me, it wasn’t so much about what I learnt from subjects taught in the classroom - though that was obviously important. But really what I learnt from my friends, and classmates - because those are things, I think, stay with you forever!</p>

<p>At school, when I was really young, I didn’t really play that many sports outside my regular PE lessons; I knew I was a very studious boy - something that was strongly shaped by my parents and the educational system I was brought up in. But then, after a few years, in the breaks and lunchtimes, I got more and more into playing sports, such as basketball, tennis, cricket, and football…, just to try out new things.</p>

<p>So I think, one of the most important lessons for me, wasn’t any kind of curriculum lesson, but a life lesson – to not be afraid of trying out new things! I think one should always try to push themselves outside of their comfort zones, and not be afraid of failure, because “failure” , is just part of <strong><em>learning process</em></strong>. If you’re not failing, you’re not learning! So, when you start something new, you just have to realise that you won’t be as good as other people – but you will, with time, get better!.</p>

<p>I think, as a phrase related to this, Aristotle once said “<strong><em>We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit</em></strong>” - so practice here definitely helps!</p>

<p>So try something new! Some things you will fail at AND won’t like! That’s fine! But there will be other things that you do like. You might fail in these at the start, but because you are <strong><em>so passionate</em></strong> about these things, - you like them so much - you’re just going to <strong><em>have the guts to continue doing that</em></strong> - <strong><em>to continue pursuing your passions</em></strong>!</p>

<p>A few years into my career, for example, I choose to leave a well-paid professional job to pursue an MBA. One of the things that I felt I needed to work really hard on, at the time, were my leadership and communication skills. I’m sure some people might have thought, why am I doing an MBA, and why in the UK, as a native English speaker? Am I doing this because I want to try to humble myself? But this was absolutely not the case!</p>

<p>I had many reasons and objectives. One of these was from a personal desire to want to improve and develop my Leadership and Communication skills, and so I was willing and prepared to work hard on these things, despite the high opportunity costs!</p>

<h2 id="question-4">Question 4</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q4. If you had the power, how would you change our educational system?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A4.</em></strong> I think what I would change is not so much in terms of the subject matter or the various topics that are taught, but the style of teaching. I feel a lot of education around the world, today at least, is done too much by rote - you’re just tested and rewarded by how well you can just memorise facts. I think some of this is imporant, and necessary, to show that you possess certain knowledge. In certain taught subjects, though, I think the rote learning can be excessive. I found this, for example, the case in certain subjects at school in subjects like: history and geography, and true to a large extent, when at the start of my career, I pursued my Chartered Qualification in Finance &amp; Accounting - there is a lot to rote learn!</p>

<p>The obvious big drawback with rote learning is that you don’t get taught “<strong><em>how to think</em></strong>”! You just memorise facts. So, I think, just teaching people how to think, both practically and logically, combined with some emotional and situational awareness, rather than just learning how to recite facts, is a very important life skill!</p>

<h2 id="question-5">Question 5</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q5. What are we missing most as a society?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A5.</em></strong> I think one important thing, is the pursuit of the <strong><em>long</em></strong> (rather than the <strong><em>short</em></strong>) term. I think with many people these days, work and life is becoming more and more about wanting to get something immediately. We have iPhones, we have iPads, we have Laptops, - instant gratification is available at our finger tips. And if somebody is bored, say in a restaurant meal, and don’t find that conversation interesting, they’ll immediately be on SnapChat or on their phones. It has become an unhealthy obsession!</p>

<p>Along with the pursuit of the long term, I think just <strong><em>being patient</em></strong> is also very important, and something that is sometimes missing from society! For example, when working on homework problems at your desk, are you focused more on your homework, or are you just being distracted by your iPhone the whole time?</p>

<p>And this kind of mindset and behaviour can apply to many other things too. For example, one way to get slim is just to have liposuction. But a better way would be to just change your diet and exercise habits - because that’s going to have much longer-term benefits!</p>

<p>Now, we live in a world and society surrounded by a lot of these “<strong><em>new age technologies</em></strong>”. Whilst I’ll admit that some of these technologies can make certain aspects of our lives easy, if they are always going to make people 24/7 hellbent on wanting to get and find INSTANT gratification, and INSTANT solutions, then I think people are not going to be engaged <em>enough</em> in investing the time in their own personal development.</p>

<h2 id="question-6">Question 6</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q6. Do you think this is going to be a problem with technology, causing us to be focusing on things we are not meant to be focusing on?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A6.</em></strong> Absolutely! When I did my MBA, I sometimes found when a Professor gave his or her lecture, that when an MBA student raised their hand and asked a question, other people would sometimes be on their iPhone or laptop, just thinking, “<em>oh, this person doesn’t really understand anything</em>”.</p>

<p>Now, I think, if you do not <strong><em>RESPECT</em></strong> that person’s question, it is <strong><em>YOU</em></strong> who loses out! - because if you cannot respect some of the qualities in another person, then it is your ignorance for not being able to see that!</p>

<p>Anyone who comes to a business school programme deserves to be there! They will each have there own reasons, and if just completely ignore that person, then that is YOUR <strong><em>prejudice</em></strong> for not listening to that person.</p>

<h2 id="question-7">Question 7</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q7. You studied Engineering at University, but then, when you graduated, started your career in the professional services industry. Why did you decide to next pursue this path?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A7.</em></strong> <strong><em>Call it creative exploration!</em></strong></p>

<p>I think, after studying science &amp; engineering for several years, and then doing various Technology &amp; Engineering Internships, what I was really wanted, was to learn and get a different perspective into business, something different from the research and development experiences I had gained, mostly in reseach labs, till then.</p>

<p>When I looked back at what my <strong><em>Engineering degree</em></strong> gave me, I saw that it had cultivated an interest and given me a good understanding of “<em>technology</em>” and “<em>manufacturing</em>” - things I don’t think I would have had the opportunity to learn about without my degree!</p>

<p>Then, when I reflected on the various work experiences I did over my University summers, I thought about the summer internship I did with PwC in my penultimate year, in London. I quite enjoyed the people and quite liked the work, and I quite liked what the department within the company did. I also always felt, in the back of my mind, that getting a few years of work experience from a well-established, global company like PwC, would provide an “<strong><em>excellent and rigorous apprenticeship</em></strong>”, and <strong><em>“very strong foundation</em></strong>” to work in any kind of business or industry, later on in my career.</p>

<p>So with these positives in mind, after graduating from University, I decided to start my post graduate career with PwC.</p>

<p>This isn’t to say that the decision to work for a Professional Services company meant that I wouldn’t want to apply any of the skills, knowledge, and networks I would build, to say, later work for an innovative <strong><em>Engineering, Media or Technology</em></strong> company - that I felt quite excited to work for later on in my career. Both my grandfather and father were Engineers for much of their careers, before they later moved into more commercial, general management, and business leadership positions, in their industries later on in their careers.</p>

<p>I felt it would be a huge honour and priviledge to be able to follow in their footsteps, and continue the family legacy in some way, by eventually moving back into Technology or Engineering or the Media &amp; Entertainment Industry. The path I chose early on in my career, just happened to be about starting with PwC.</p>

<h2 id="question-8">Question 8</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q8. What were your experiences like at PwC?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A8.</em></strong> I learnt a tremendous amount. Overall, I had a decent time.</p>

<p>It was certainly a time that made me realise the tremendous impact that those working in Professional Services can have on society. When I was there:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I got to work with, and learn from a lot of <strong><em>smart</em></strong>, <strong><em>motivated</em></strong>, and very <strong><em>experienced</em></strong> people - from a range of different backgrounds, cultures and ages – but all with a very keen interest in business, and in what it takes to run, grow, develop, or acquire one.</li>
  <li>I also got the opportunity to work with a <strong><em>wide range of companies</em></strong>, to help solve a range of strategic and financial problems - which was extremely stimulating!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-9">Question 9</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q9. Can you tell me a bit more about PwC, and when you were there, the path you took?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A9.</em></strong> Well, you can think of most Professional Service companies (or firms as they like to call themselves), as having three main areas:</p>

<p>(i) <strong><em>Tax</em></strong>, (ii) <strong><em>Business Consulting</em></strong>, and (iii) <strong><em>Assurance</em></strong>.</p>

<p>For the first and last, I would say you need very strong Finance &amp; Accounting and Organisational skills; and for Business Consulting, you need strong Creative, Analytical, and Logical thinking skills. In my case, my path started in the firm’s Advisory department - in a small division called the Strategy Group, where I worked as a General Business Analyst - doing mostly desk-based market research - e.g. such as Commercial Due Dilligence work. I worked in that division in a full time position for 1.5 years.</p>

<p>Then, after working in the company’s Advisory department, for about 18 months, I started to become more and more interested in the idea of pursuing a Chartered Qualification of some kind, something like a C.A. - which the company offered, had encouraged many of its Employees to do.</p>

<p>My thoughts at the time – particularly straight after doing something like an Engineering degree, was that spending some time in the company’s Assurance department - both tactically, but also thinking about the longer term, would be a very good route for me to pursue - as I continued to maintain my interests in the <strong><em>Technology &amp; Engineering and Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong> sectors. So, I decided to do that instead. After 18 months, I moved across from the company’s Advisory department to the company’s Assurance department.</p>

<p>The Assurance Department was a lot of hard work (I worked mostly in its Investment Management Division). As I did my C.A., I was able to learn a lot of new skills, and it was a great opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Learn more</em></strong> about <strong><em>business &amp; finance</em></strong> (something that I didn’t have that much practical or theoreticcal experience of, having done a degree in Science &amp; Engineering)</li>
  <li>Get a much better appreciation of the different types of <strong><em>challenges</em></strong> and <strong><em>risks</em></strong> that might be faced when running a business, by understanding some of the internal business controls they have and put in place.</li>
  <li>Get a <strong><em>well-regarded business qualification</em></strong>, something that was well-respected, internationally well-recognised, and where I could learn a lot of new skills that I couldn’t get the opportunity to learn otherwise – something I felt would stand me in good stead throughout my career.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the more I worked, the more I found and discovered how <strong><em>practical</em></strong> the finance people can actually be.</p>

<p>I think it is a profession that can <strong><em>sometimes be misunderstood</em></strong>! For example, often people think that those who work in the finance – all they really care about is making a lot of money. Though there is some truth to this, those with a lot of experience can actually do a lot to make the profession, <strong><em>more accessible and universally understood</em></strong>, to members of society - who are perhaps less familiar with the profession, but who are in real need some financial guidance and advice.</p>

<p>People with some finance experience can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a) Explain finance in <strong><em>simple terms</em></strong> to a variety of business stakeholders, to help them make better investment and financing decisions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>b) More broadly make finance, and the profession a <strong><em>force for good</em></strong>, for both business and society.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-10">Question 10</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q10. When you took the path you did at PwC, how was it?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A10.</em></strong> For me, there were both <strong><em>peaks</em></strong> and <strong><em>troughs</em></strong> - something that probably everyone gets with any job!</p>

<p>Before I moved across to the Assurance Department, a lot of people would scare me of the long hours – especially in London. And of how as a junior, I would be given a lot of the mundane work - and that this was just the way things were going to be for a while.</p>

<p>Some aspects of this are definitely true! The hours were long, and a lot of the junior level work can be relatively dull and mundane. But then, I think, the same is probably true wherever you start - whatever the company or industry. As you get more experience though, the more you learn - and, provided you’re working with talented, collaborative, and supportive people, who are genuinely interested in their own work and your personal development - then the more interesting and fulfiling the work will become!</p>

<p>I would say, it’s also true that there can sometimes be people who can be difficult to deal with: some quite arrogant, some quite xenophobic: some, you feel, not very competent, and you wonder how they got to where they are in the first place! Whilst these things can easily annoy and frustrate you, it’s important to not be affected by these people or by that kind of environment, but to recognise, and instead think of how you can instead best work with these people. <em>Most</em> people in business have worked very hard to get to where they are, so if these people are still there, they’re probably there for a good reason. So it helps if you can think about how you could change your own behaviour and working style to be able to effectively work with these people.</p>

<p>I guess one thing that I did not like in the Assurance department, because I had a lot of interests and hobbies: tennis being one of them, film &amp; music, health &amp; fitness, and spending time with friends, being others - were the long hours, I found these difficult to fit in. Studying for all the exams that working towards a CA involves, whilst working in a demanding full-time job, meant having to give up a lot of my weekends. And doing that for 3 years, was a big sacrifice and something I found very tough.</p>

<p>If people do end up working in Professional Services, for a company like PwC, or any other company like that, early on in their careers, then they should ask themselves what they want from the experience, and how they feel the experience they will get fits into their overall long-term career plan! These companies are great training grounds, and provide fantastic opportunities to learn more about areas such as: how to advice on large scale Business Transactions, or how to provide various kinds of Business Assurance services, or more technical services related to Finance &amp; Accounting, or Tax. And if becoming a Partner in Assurance, Advisory, or Tax - in a Big 4 Practice firm environment - is something you really want to do, for the rest of your 40-50 career - then you’re probably already in the right place! For me, personally, after I worked in the company’s Advisory and then Assurance deparment, and had obtained my Chartered Qualification, my C.A., I knew that I had a different long term plan!</p>

<p>To aspiring graduates, and young professionals, seeking to start their careers at a place like the Big 4, I will say that you will have to work hard, and there will be a lot to sacrifice you have to make, in terms of extracurricular activities, possibly too, other exciting career opportunities, in other industries or sectors, that might appeal to you more, or which you might be even more passionate about! So, it’s important to keep your eyes wide open to what’s available to you, even if you are already inside a Professional Services or what lies ahead, and what’s available in the wider world!</p>

<p>Get to know and work with people in other fields just to ensure that your subject, or work, doesn’t become all you think or know about! Over the course of your career, your work should be soul restoring! It should not be soul destroying!</p>

<h2 id="question-11">Question 11</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q11. After 6 years, you then left PwC, and chose to do your MBA? Why?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A11.</em></strong></p>

<p>Yes, after having worked in Professional Services, in what ended up being a fairly technical role for some years, I wanted a change and was looking for my next challenge. Specifically, I wanted to <strong><em>widen my knowledge</em></strong> of business (beyond what I learnt in the Assurance and Advisory departments at PwC), and also get some experience of what it was like working in other business functions outside of Finance like: Marketing, Human Resources, Strategy, Operations, Technology, Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship, or other areas in Finance I had not had that much exposure to before (such as: Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity). I also wanted a <strong><em>better exposure to International Commerce</em></strong> - to work abroad for a multi-national company - and work Senior Management and Leadership teams there, to help solve an interesting and challenging business problem that had an International focus, rather than for just UK based companies.</p>

<p>So, these were the main things I wanted to get from my MBA.</p>

<p>Besides this, I also wanted more of my own time to futher my interests in: the <strong><em>Technology &amp; Engineering</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong> sectors, as those were the sectors that in the longer term attracted me the most - and were the ones I was most passionate about.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At University, I studied Engineering for 4 years, which I had enjoyed – it is a subject that is very multi-disciplinary in its outlook - and as much about fostering <strong><em>creative</em></strong> and <strong><em>innovative</em></strong> thinking, through design, as it is about trying to solve the more <strong><em>technical challenges</em></strong> faced by Engineers &amp; Technologists in different industries. The discipline helps “<em>build bridges</em>”, across “<em>social boundaries</em>”, to those in society who are less fortunate than others.</li>
  <li>At the same time, at University, I also fostered a deep interest in <strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong>. I ran my College’s Film Club - the Gonville &amp; Caius Film Society - for 4 years, which was all about hosting and showcasing engaging and entertaining films, for college and university students. I made it a point too to see a few films at the MIT Film Club, when I was there in Boston in my 3rd year, watching great conspiracy thrillers like the “Constant Gardener”.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, yes, after about 6 years I left my roles at PwC to do my MBA, to also help me move closer to the Engineering &amp; Technology, and Media &amp; Entertainment sectors. The shift, along with the experiences from my MBA, I felt would help me move into a challenging business role with an innovative company in one of these two sectors. With the experience I have had upto that point, it’s a decision I don’t regret at all!</p>

<h2 id="question-12">Question 12</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q12. Now, that you have done your MBA, what do you think it gave you?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A12.</em></strong> I think quite a lot, probably too much to be able to summarise in just one answer. But, if I had to name two, or three things, I would say:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>One:</em></strong> A <strong><em>much wider knowledge</em></strong> of business, and <strong><em>greater exposure to Global commerce</em></strong> - as I had originally intended, and hoped for. So, experiences and exposure to areas such as: marketing, human resourcing, strategic management, business consulting, and other areas in finance (such as venture capital &amp; private equity, and mergers &amp; acquisitions), that I did not have much earlier experience in.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Second:</em></strong> The <strong><em>realisation</em></strong> that with all I had learnt, that I could have much <strong><em>more impact</em></strong> and <strong><em>enjoyment</em></strong> doing things where my <strong><em>bandwidth was a lot higher</em></strong>! So rather than just working for one or two companies, trying to solve their technical finance or accounting, advisory, or assurance problems, across the whole year – all the time - I could get to work on a much broader range of problems, working in cross-functional teams, in the companies and industries that I was most passionate about. It’s something I realised that I would not be able to do if I stayed with a “Big 4 Practice” type firm, like PwC, for the rest of my career.</li>
</ul>

<p>One extra <strong><em>third</em></strong> thing I got from my MBA was that it really helped with my <strong><em>own personal development</em></strong>. After a very intensive two years, I had become better at working in teams, a better leader, a better networker, a better presenter, and better at giving talks to larger audiences. This wasn’t something I had to do much of in my earlier roles at PwC.</p>

<p>I think all the things that I did learn from my MBA, in terms of: skills developed, knowledge gained, materials acquired, and friends made, these are things that are going to become even more useful and valuable to me, as I continue to progress in my career. Having an MEng, CA, and MBA, personally, it’s a very unique and powerful combination - something, I think, very few people can say they have on their CVs…</p>

<p>Lastly, I would say, if anyone is thinking of doing an MBA, and manages to get admitted into a Internationally well-networked, Business School, with a strong track record, then provided they work hard, and are willing to apply themselves, then apart from the specifics of what you do on the programme itself - it is also (i) a “<strong><em>badge of accomplishment</em></strong>” that communicates a very high standard of excellence to others: (ii) shows that you have a better and more <strong><em>commercial understanding</em></strong> of business, and (iii) an ability to build <strong><em>mutually-respectful business relationships</em></strong> - which are all things that are going to help you a lot in the future!</p>

<h2 id="question-13">Question 13</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q13. What appeals to you specifically about the Engineering &amp; Technology, and Media &amp; Entertainment sectors?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A13.</em></strong> These are just the sectors whose products and services I would like to see more of in the world!</p>

<p>The interest started from a very early age, and was strongly influenced by those around me: my parents, siblings, friends, and wider family - and my interest has just developed further since.</p>

<p>With Engineering &amp; Technology, I’ve always been very interested in understanding How Things Work. When I was young, for example, I remember my dad buying a book called “<em>The Way Things Work</em>”, by David Macaulay - (published by the very popular education publisher, at the time, Dorling Kindersley (DK)). It was a book that really caught my fascination!</p>

<p>Then I remember also enjoying several other Educational CDs my parent’s had bought me, such as the Encarta Multi-Media Encyclopedia, by Microsoft. Its vast repository of digital articles and multi-media videos allowed me to learn a lot more about Science &amp; Engineering. You could store quite a lot in those days on 700MB of memory! Before this, my main source of knowledge of the world, and world history, came from a “<em>12 Volume Britannica Encylopedia Collection</em>” that my grandparents had gifted to me when I was very young.</p>

<p>The Media &amp; Entertainment sector too, has always been a one of interest for me.</p>

<p>When I was young, for example, I remember really enjoying the Violin lessons my mother used to send me to. Then after playing the violin for a sometime, I really enjoyed playing the musical keyboard (a Casio, from Japan) that my Grand Parents also bought for me for my ninth birthday.</p>

<p>Then, whenever I used to visit them on Holiday, I used to enjoy going for musical keyboard lessons, where I got to learn how to play different kinds of songs. (The song, lambada sticks to mind with me the most!)</p>

<p>Then after learning how to play music, my Dad and Uncle began introducing me to Photography - which is when I first started to learn how to take photos - with a 35mm (Olympus) Camera. A few years after that, I got my first ever digital camera, a Canon PowerShot A30, which I would use to take photos with whenever I went abroad. A few years after this, I then bought my first ever Digital SLR Camera, from Akihabara, (a popular eletronics district) in Tokyo, Japan.</p>

<p>Though I don’t use it as much now, my Parents also bought a Video Camera, which I would sometimes use to take short videos with, whenever we went out for Picnics, or for some Sightseeing, with family and friends. Then, the first time I visited Texas, Houston, visiting and seeing my first 3-D film ever at an IMAX, about an adventure in Space, that had a lasting impression on me! And so did the other 3-D films I saw later, in other IMAX theatres and cinemas across the world!</p>

<p>Then, of course, after that, I maintained my interest in Films &amp; Music at University, when I helped to run my Colleges Film Society as its President.</p>

<p>So, I believe, there has always been this very strong creative streak in me, and interest to continue to want to work in the Media &amp; Entertainment sector.</p>

<p>There have been other examples too, of great experiences I’ve had that have been associated with these two sectors.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Really enjoying the “<strong><em>Product Design</em></strong>” class I took when I went to MIT, where, amongst other things, I got to learn a bit more about how to create great products and some of the principles behind desining a great website!</li>
  <li>Then, very vividly remembering how, in another assignment in that class, being tasked with trying to improve the design of an American AutomaticTellerMachine (ATM) (one that would return your card <strong><em>before</em></strong> it tried to dispense any cash, as I remember always get quite annoyed by how some ATMs would dispense back your card <strong><em>after</em></strong> it dispensed back any cash, which meant that if you were in a hurry, you would remember to take your cash, but almost always forget to take your card!)</li>
  <li>I also remember how in a “<strong><em>Design &amp; Manufacturing</em></strong>” class, in one of the projects for that class, being in a design team that was able to design a Yo-Yo with the fewest number of parts - only 3!. It thought it was a really innovative design. The class professors and supervisors liked it so much, that they awarded us the class first prize for that design project!</li>
  <li>I have vivid memories too of how I used to stay up till 1 o’clock in the morning, working in the Technology Institute’s main Photography Darkroom Lab, a few floors above the Infinite Corridor, in the main Engineering Building on Campus, trying to develop photo negatives for a class project I was trying to complete, as part of a “<strong><em>Creative Imaging</em></strong>” class I had taken - and one night, having to run through a snow blizzard to try and catch the last shuttle bus from the Zeisiger Sports &amp; Fitness Center, to my Fraternity, Theta Chi, which was all the way across Harvard Bridge on the other side of the Charles River. It was a frigid, and bitterly cold night! But I did get my photos!</li>
  <li>Then, back in England, in Cambridge, outside of my usual Engineering classes, in my free time, I remember really enjoying running my college’s Film Society - Caius Films. We used to screen a selection of films each week, across all three terms of the year: Michaelmas, Lent, and Easter, screening films all the way from (i) old classics, such as: Butch Cassidy &amp; the Sundance Kid, and Shawshank Redemption, (ii) contemporary films (contemporary for my generation at least) such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Lucky Number Slevin, Mystic River, and The Colour Purple, (iii) foreign films, such as: Amelie, and Swades, to (vi) Anime and Animation type Films, such as: Finding Nemo, and Spirited Away.</li>
  <li>And I found that really enjoyable! Not only did having a college run film society give the University &amp; College students the opportunity to learn new things from watching some really interesting films, (conveniently from inside college), but a chance too, to get a few hours of relieving Entertainment, after a week of intense lectures and practicals.</li>
  <li>In my years since University, Photography is still something I try to maintain an interest in, and make a concious effort to try to use my Japanese SLR when I can.</li>
  <li>Thinking about some of the Engineering &amp; Technology projects I have done, the one I did in Fujisawa, near Tokyo, in Japan for a few months, is one that I really enjoyed. It was an opportunity I found through one of my dad’s class mates (they both studied in the same class at IIT, the Indian Institute of Technology). My Dad’s friend was working with Hitachi GST at the time, and felt that there was a project that I could really help with given what I had learn about Manufacturing Systems from my Engineering degree, so invited me to Japan for an 10-week work internship.</li>
  <li>There, I ended up working with Hitachi GST Senior Management and Leadership, to help build a simulation model that could better quantify the costs and benefits of using a robotic handler across their manufacturing plans, to better automate parts of their Hard Disk Manufacturing production. Apart from the actual work at Hitachi, the trip was also a great opportunity to practice some of my Japanese language skills (which I had taken a class on, at MIT), and learn more about Japan itself: its people, culture, history, food, architecture, and natural scenery!</li>
  <li>Of the more recent Projects, those I did over my MBA, as part of my specialist elective class on “Advanced Strategic Management” class - where, I spent a whole summer learning more about the Electric Car Industry – and how the automotive company, “<em>BMW</em>” could further develop its own Electric cars business - was really interesting. In the same class, I also did an individual dissertation on the Media and Entertainment Company, “<em>Walt Disney</em>” - where I was able to think about and recommend ways I felt the “<em>Walt Disney Company</em>” could better develop and strengthen its product &amp; market portfolio.</li>
  <li>Then in the Finance electives I took in “Corporate Recovery &amp; Turnaround), (just after my “Advanced Strategic Management” elective) I got to research and suggest different ways of improving the performance of the Video Games Company, “<em>Nintendo</em>”. That was really interesting to me, because I got to learn more about Nintendo, as well as the evolution and changing dynamics of the global “Video Games” industry.</li>
  <li>Thinking about some more examples in Media, Technology &amp; Entertainment, I enjoyed taking “Drama” for my IGCSEs. In that class, I remember performing really well in a school play we did on “Billy Liar”, which we later then did as a more public performance, at both my school, the British (Embassy) School - and then later, the American Embassy School, (the school that was just across the road from us). I remember being very pleasantly surprised too when I got an A* in Drama for my IGCSEs - as it wasn’t something I was expecting. That moment still leaves me with a very strong desire to want to go and watch musicals and West End Theatre, ever so often!</li>
  <li>Now, even to the present day, working the way I have, in the years since my MBA, I have focused most of my work search efforts on those companies that I believe to be innovative organisations in the <strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment sectors</em></strong>. For example, I worked for 3-months for the UK automotive company, Jaguar Land Rover. After that, I worked for the Marketing &amp; Advertising agency, WPP, in London, across several agencies, for a year, as they were trying to simplify their business in the face of several challenges being faced by the Marketing &amp; Advertising industry. It was enjoyable work for my and I enjoyed the company culture!</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I think, whilst I could probably do well working across a lot of different sectors (with the skills and experiences I have acquired), the sectors which have appealed to me the most, the ones I have been most passionate about, and really proud of working in, will probably always be the <strong><em>Enginering &amp; Technology</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong> ones. And this is something I want to continue to be able to do!</p>

<h2 id="question-14">Question 14</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q14. What keeps you busy now?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A14.</em></strong> Well, soon after my MBA, I decided to go ahead and <strong><em>start my own company</em></strong>. I did this for a few reasons:</p>

<p>After my MBA, the economic outlook in the U.K. became very uncertain, and because of the publics vote for “Brexit” in a national referendum, to leave the European Union, this has badly affected the economy and many UK businesses. It was really bad luck for me, as companies had reduced their hiring activities for lots of people at my level (MBA level)</p>

<p>So, I decided, rather than let my destiny be defined by the whims and fancies of what companies in the U.K, that I just go ahead and start up a company. I saw major benefits: greater freedom, increased flexibility, and more personal control over the types of projects and assignments I could apply to work on. I had never started a limited company before, and felt it would be a great opportunity to apply some of my ACA and MBA learnings.</p>

<p>And as I looked for paid work, I also started to read and learn more about new and upcoming areas such as those in “<em>Artificial Intelligence</em>”, “<em>Machine Learning</em>”, “<em>Data Science</em>”, and “<em>Business Intelligence</em>” - which were becoming more popular and more popular.</p>

<p>Having more control over the kinds of projects I do, and for which kinds of companies, and not being geographically contrained to just one country, I’ve been able to do a lot of exciting and interesting work!</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work for a short time for a Charitable District Eye Hospital, that needed some help in improving and developing their Internal Management Information systems;</li>
  <li>Work for an innovative health-drinks start-up, “<em>Happy Ratio</em>”, that needed someone to help them in with soem commercial deal negotiations, as they looked to grow and expand into International markets;</li>
  <li>Work for an international social and behavioural change communication agency, “<em>Magenta Consulting</em>”, to help them with some finance work - helping them better prepare and compare their (financial) forecasts, budgets, and acutals, for their investors;</li>
  <li>Getting the time to explore and experiment with developing a few tailored (software based) product offerings of my own!</li>
</ul>

<p>It has all been a lot of hard work, but a lot of really enjoyable work - which has allowed me to apply all of what I have learnt across the years in: Finance, Technology, Data Engineering, Data Science, and Business Intelligence, to some very diverse roles in: the Finance, Marketing, Strategy, and HR departments of these companies. It has been really fulfilling and satisfying work for me!</p>

<p><strong><em>Outside work:</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>What has been keeping me busy, has just been supporting the local communities in where I live: for example, giving tuition lessons to a young boy in my home town, who needed help with preparing for his UK based, GCSE Maths exams. Then helping a nearby couple better prepare their two young toddlers for home schooling lessons - by writing a comprehensive Nursery-level Home-Schooling Guide for them.</li>
  <li>In terms of my own Health and Fitness outside work, I have no specific goal, but it is something I enjoy doing, so, I try to maintain that, just to try and keep in good tone, and a healthy physique.</li>
  <li>In my spare time, I also enjoy playing sports, racquet sports such as Tennis and Table Tennis, and following International Cricket tournaments, Formula 1 motorsport, watching films (of course!), watching and reading science and technology books and documentaries, and participating in a range of cultural and gastronomic activities with family and friends.</li>
</ul>

<p>So there are many things outside work that keep me busy! There may be some things I will work on without a clear target, or KPI, just because I enjoy, and am very passionate about those things!</p>

<h2 id="question-15">Question 15</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q15. What is going to continue to motivate you?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A15.</em></strong> I think, what is going to continue to motivate me are just my interests and passions, and finding opportunities where I can continue to pursue and achieve these, to a high professional standard.</p>

<p>For me, this means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Getting the opportunity to continue to work with innovative companies, with smart, motivated, and accomplished people, who want to solve tough and challenging problems, that have the potential to change the world for the better. This, of course, is something, I acknowledge, will change over time: with different industry cycles, with different generations of people, it will also mean different things to different people. But, personally, this means working hard, so I can keep pushing myself outside of my comfort zone, and keey trying out new things, hopefully still with companies in the <strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong> sectors</li>
  <li>I think one other big thing that I would say which would also continue to motivate me, is my interest and desire to want to continue to see different parts of the world, and meet new people.</li>
  <li>I have travelled to quite a few places across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Southern Africa, and North America. One particularly memorable and enjoyable holiday experience for me was on a wildlife expedition to Botswana - when  in one of the campsites, in Linyati Camp, in Chobe National Park, we came in very close contact with pride of lions (the Savuti Pride) - it was such a surreal moment and experience for me! So, I think, continuing to try and visit new places, and continuing to try to open myself out to new experiences and meet new people, is something that is going to continue to motivate me!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="question-16">Question 16</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q16. What are your values?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A16.</em></strong> In a sentence, I would say these would be to “<strong><em>work in a way that honors: respect and collaboration, but in way that is still innovative and authentic</em></strong>”.</p>

<p>I don’t see any aspects of this being an “<strong><em>either, or</em></strong>”. <strong><em>Honor, respect, authenticity, collaboration</em></strong>, and <strong><em>innovativeness</em></strong>, are values that have always been very important to me. These are values that, as I have had the time to reflect more and more on who I am as a person, and on what I believe makes me tick, will continue to be values I will try to center my life around.</p>

<p>If someone asked me for a comprehensive list, I would say my values would be to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be <strong><em>respectful, kind</em></strong>, and <strong><em>loyal</em></strong> to others – to always treat others as I would like to be treated myself</li>
  <li>Be <strong><em>open-minded</em></strong> to new ideas, and to seek every opportunity to <strong><em>learn new things</em></strong> and embark on new horizons.</li>
  <li>Always try to keep to every commitment, <strong><em>safely</em></strong> and <strong><em>legally</em></strong></li>
  <li>Confront challenges, and not to shy away from taking responsibility for my actions.</li>
  <li>Believe in being successful, <strong><em>financially</em></strong>, <strong><em>physically</em></strong>, and <strong><em>emotionally</em></strong> - not only for myself, but also for the benefit of those around me (e.g. friends, family, and wider, immediate community)</li>
  <li>Have <strong><em>freedom of expression</em></strong>, and be able to <strong><em>be creative</em></strong>, but not criticize what I do not understand!</li>
  <li>Believe that, above all else, to be <strong><em>happy</em></strong> and <strong><em>fulfilled</em></strong> in what I do!</li>
</ul>

<p>Every day, I try to live up to my values. If I’m honest, I don’t think I will ever succeed at living up to all of them, but I think if I didn’t write them down or read them regularly, I would fail even more miserably in trying to live by them!</p>

<h2 id="question-17">Question 17</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q17. What are the advantages of an MBA?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A17.</em></strong> Having gone through one myself, I think there are many. It’s tough to summarise all of them in one go, but, here are a few:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One, I think, are the important lessons you learn, from studying the <strong><em>successes and failures</em></strong> of variety of different businesses in the classroom from the Professors. Though, you may not, in these hours, be working on any actual live business project, this classroom learning is still very important, as what you learn are the findings of the Professors from researching and studying 100s of different companies, rather than what you might learn from just one long case study, or one isolated business project.</li>
  <li>Second, I would say are the <strong><em>people</em></strong>. The MBA people I met and worked with at my school were from all over the world (from over 30 different nationalities, in my year group alone!). I think, when you get to work in such <strong><em>a melting pot</em></strong> of such a <strong><em>diverse group</em></strong> of people, you learn a lot from their <strong><em>different perspectives &amp; working styles</em></strong>, and also of how important something like “<strong><em>culture</em></strong>” in business planning and decision making, especially in International contexts, can be. In fact, with the people you meet, what you might achieve, by going on such an MBA progress, are <strong><em>friends</em></strong> who may potentially go on to become your <strong><em>friends for the rest of your life!</em></strong></li>
  <li>Third, I would say are the opportunities you get for <strong><em>extra-curricular development</em></strong>. You’ll learn a lot in the classroom, but your learning shouldn’t just be confined to books, libraries, and business case studies. When I did my MBA, I personally felt I got quite a lot through its <strong><em>extra-curricular activities</em></strong>. They helped develop in me, a much <strong><em>stronger attitude</em></strong> and <strong><em>confidence</em></strong> of wanting to <strong><em>push myself</em></strong>, and <strong><em>try out new things</em></strong>!</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, I got the opportunity to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Mentor</em></strong> and <strong><em>teach</em></strong> students on the basic principles of finance and accounting to help my classmates get through our Accounting, Corporate Finance, and Economics classes, by becoming a member of the school’s Banking &amp; Finance society</li>
  <li><strong><em>Coach</em></strong> my classmates through business consulting case studies, by becoming a member of the school’s Consulting Club</li>
  <li><strong><em>Represent</em></strong> my school in a Private Equity Case Competition that was being held in Amsterdam, Holland, as part of the specialist elective some members of our class took in “Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity”. My team didn’t win the competition, but we did learn some valuable lessons!</li>
  <li><strong><em>Take part in</em></strong> (and at times <strong><em>co-captain</em></strong>) our Table Tennis team as we prepared for the annual Sports Tournament, MBAT, in France, a tournament that was attended by all the other leading MBA schools across Europe</li>
  <li>Help with <strong><em>social events</em></strong>, whenever I could fit in the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I was able to get involved in quite a lot, because I had already learnt and knew about some of these areas from my earlier pre-MBA experiences - so had more time to not only impart the knowledge I already had, by teaching and coaching my classmates as a member of the <strong><em>Banking &amp; Finance Society</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Consulting Clubs</em></strong>, but also participate in a wider range of activities with my cohort.</p>

<p>Personally, when it comes to thinking about the advantages of such a course, I think there are so many strands of <strong><em>personal development</em></strong>, <strong><em>leadership</em></strong>, and <strong><em>communication</em></strong> that you will get, just by being in an environment with a lot of <strong><em>smart</em></strong> and <strong><em>motivated</em></strong> people - every day - for two years - that it is that <strong><em>hive of activity</em></strong> that you will get from an MBA!</p>

<h2 id="question-18">Question 18</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q18. What is the typical student that goes on an MBA?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A18.</em></strong> I think, it varies quite a lot. I don’t think there is a <strong><em>typical student</em></strong>, but they say the average age is <strong><em>28</em></strong>. I think, from my experiences, that it might range from 23 to 35. (I did my MBA when I just turned 30).</p>

<p>Some students, quite a large percentage of them, might have worked previously in Invement Banking or some kind of Business Consulting company. (I had come from a Professional Services / Technology &amp; Engineering background). But its not always the case. Some might have been ex-army personnel. Some of them might have worked for social enterprises, or have been entrepreneurs, now wanting to try something new and different. Some might have been working in family businesses. There may also be some who were doctors, who now want to learn how to run or manage their own clinic. So, it really is quite diverse!</p>

<p>I think when it comes to people wanting to further educate themselves, sometimes people might think they’re already very successful in their profession, and that they are already learning a lot, so will just stay where they are. This might be true! But, I think, by going onto an MBA programme, at least from what I experienced, you just <strong><em>learn from a more diverse group of people</em></strong>, with a much <strong><em>greater diversity</em></strong> and <strong><em>perspective</em></strong>. And that’s a valuable experience you can take with your for the rest of your working career.</p>

<h2 id="question-19">Question 19</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q19. Do you see that it is much more competitive to get onto an MBA course?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A19.</em></strong> I think it is competitive, but I don’t think the competitiveness is necessarily in terms of having the best resume by traditional standards. I don’t think MBA recruiters are always looking for those people with the highest grades at school, or for those who might have worked at a certain kind of company, or within any specific kind of industry before. They’ll have some criteria around this, but it won’t just be around this!</p>

<p>I do however think that it is competitive, in terms of their search for people with great <strong><em>personality</em></strong> and <strong><em>character</em></strong>, and what these kind of people can bring with their time at Business School. I think many schools would rather have somebody from a non-traditional background, who has the <strong><em>openness to learn</em></strong>, and willingness to <strong><em>mentor</em></strong> and <strong><em>teach</em></strong> other people in their MBA class cohort.</p>

<p>I also think that sometimes people mistakedly think of competition as being something that excludes people from <strong><em>lowly backgrounds</em></strong>. I don’t think anybody is ever excluded from an MBA programme. I think those people who might be excluded, are those who are not willing to contribute to the community, rather than those people who don’t have or come from a particular kind of social, educational, or ethnic background.</p>

<h2 id="question-20">Question 20</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q20. What are the most successful character properties to be a business owner and leader?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A20.</em></strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I think, number one would be <strong><em>humility</em></strong> and <strong><em>responsiveness</em></strong> to feedback!</p>

    <p>I think, often, as a leader, you can sometimes think that because you’re <strong><em>the leader</em></strong>, you’ve got to the top, you think you know more than these other people. But, I think, a lot of what you get from an organization is actually from <strong><em>tapping into the other people!</em></strong></p>

    <p>Related to the above, I also think that a leader who is <strong><em>too autocratic</em></strong> is one who is not using the <strong><em>power of his employees</em></strong>. When I was on a tour, for example, at one of the Hitachi GST factories in Japan, one of the Engineers there showed me how a certain part of the production process for making hard disk drives came from the company’s employee’s suggestion scheme. It wasn’t the leader, or Chief Technology Officer, or Chief Executive Officer, who thought, I know best, let me design it myself. Instead, the <strong><em>leader listened to his or her employees.</em></strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think number two, would be, to <strong><em>be creative</em></strong>.</p>

    <p>I recently read, over one of these summers, a book called <strong><em>Zero to One</em></strong>, by Peter Thiele, the founder of PayPal, written for those wishing to learn more about what it takes to found a <strong><em>break-through</em></strong> company. Peter Thiele says in the book that the most difficult thing is moving from <strong><em>Zero to One</em></strong>, rather than from <strong><em>One to Hundred</em></strong>. Peter Thiele created the first online mobile payment system - a <strong><em>Zero to One</em></strong> move. Now, there can be lots of replica business ideas, moving from <strong><em>One to a Hundred</em></strong>, but, to do the first one, is extremely challenging!
 So, Peter Thiele understood the importance of being creative, and being able to think outside the box.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Third, I think, just as with many other things, is <strong><em>commitment</em></strong> and <strong><em>focus</em></strong>!</p>

    <p>You can’t be all things to all people! Peter Thiele thought let us <strong><em>focus</em></strong> on launching PayPal, rather than thinking, I’ve got 100 ideas and let me try to look at them all.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="question-21">Question 21</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q21. What are your strengths and what are your weaknesses?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A21.</em></strong></p>

<p>I think, one strength I have is <strong><em>commitment</em></strong>. I think, in whatever it is that you want to do, you need be focused and committed. In athletics classes, for example, you might find people who run to a line, but then stop half the way, and then start walking. In business (and life, more generally), I don’t think that approach is going to get you much success. Whatever it is that you want to do, you should be wholly committed, and focus, and pursue that thing with a real sense of <strong><em>confidence</em></strong>, <strong><em>clarity</em></strong>, and <strong><em>conviction</em></strong>!</p>

<p>Number Two, I think, is the ability to be <strong><em>open-minded</em></strong>. Presenting information very formally in front of large audiences, and writing lots management reports wasn’t something that came naturally to me, before I did my MBA (it was not something I had to do much of in my roles at PwC). But later, as I got more practice and experience, it was something I really came to like. So just being open-minded about trying new things, I think, is very important.</p>

<p>Number three, I think, is just <strong><em>being positive</em></strong>. Having a positive mindset, I think, is critical for success on a lot of dimensions. You can start something new and then think, this is difficult, I’m going to give up! Or you can start something new and think, this is something that actually is difficult, but I like the challenge, I am going to persist with it, try, and try again, until I succeed!</p>

<h2 id="question-22">Question 22</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q22. How do you put yourself into that positive frame of mind? What do you do?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A22.</em></strong> Part of the way I do this is by <strong><em>practicing gratitude</em></strong>. I think that other people often think, in life, that “happy people” are just born lucky - for example, that they were just born into a wealthy family. But <strong><em>happiness is a choice</em></strong>!</p>

<p>I think there are many things that we can be grateful for. For example, I think that a lot of people could, at any point, pay for somebody to cook for them, and then have that person clean up for them afterwards …they can go to a restaurant. But, I think that this is something that many people still take for granted, because they are so used to it! For example, I can turn on the tap, and get clean water. So, that is something I too am very grateful for!</p>

<p>I think that the act of <strong><em>practicing gratitude</em></strong> is something that is still very <strong><em>counter-cultural</em></strong> in many countries and societies - because we always like to <strong><em>complain about poor customer service</em></strong>. But the act of <strong><em>practicing gratitude requires great discipline!</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="question-23">Question 23</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q23. Is being where you are now a childhood dream?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A23.</em></strong> Absolutely not!</p>

<p>I think, when I was young, I used to watch a lot of Steven Spielberg films, and read Science Fiction Novels - those by Arthur C. Clarke, Jules Verne, Isaak Asimov, and H.G. Wells. Then, after seeing Jurassic Park in the early 1990s, a lot of Cartoon Network, Hannah Barbara productions, lots of Disney Films, and some Futuristic Sci-Fi Hollywood for the first time, that I wanted to become a Film Director, or Rocket Scientist. Then after watching a lot of Ally McBeal, and TV series like Due South, during my adolescent years, that perhaps I wanted to become a lawyer so I could go to trial and do those debates, or be a Mounty Police Officer with a Siberian Husky, called “<em>Diefenbacker</em>”, just like that person on Due South.</p>

<p>A few years later, when I then went to University to study Engineering, after 4 years, I then went to work in Professional Services, to get a different kind of perspective and experience, and learn about areas such as Finance &amp; Accounting, and Tax.</p>

<p>And having worked in Professional Services, after a few years, I was looking for just a new kind of experience, something that was more commercial, and less technical, that would give me a better exposure to international commerce, and other functions in a business.</p>

<p>So, I then did my MBA, to meet new people, work on problems in new industries, to learn more widely about business, and to try to find out more about the topics, companies, and industries that interested me the most.</p>

<p>And since then, I have been working through my own company, and engaging in, and with the topics, companies, and industries I am most passionate about!</p>

<h2 id="question-24">Question 24</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q24. What does the future hold for you?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A24.</em></strong> <strong><em>Thats a great question!</em></strong></p>

<p>The honest answer is that <strong><em>I don’t know</em></strong>, and I think that is what makes life <strong><em>so exciting, - you never know what is going to be next.</em></strong></p>

<p>A decade ago, I don’t think I would ever have known that I would be where I am now. When I was young, I think I wanted to be a film director or rocket scientist!</p>

<p>At University I did Engineering, and after 4 years said to myself that I wasn’t going to do further academic study for sometime, I’m going to go into Professional Services, learn about a different area of business.</p>

<p>But now, I’m steering myself towards the <strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong> sectors.</p>

<p>Before I never used to be that much into sport and health and fitness, but I am now more into it.</p>

<p>So, again, I think it is <strong><em>impossible to predict the future</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I think, what makes life very exciting is that you want to <strong><em>remain open-minded</em></strong>. Therefore, <strong><em>if new opportunities come along</em></strong>, I don’t think one should say say: “<em>oh I never thought of this, let me just ignore this</em>”. I think, we want to still be opened to it, but we still want to <strong><em>maintain our focus</em></strong>! So, it doesn’t mean we are going to be “<em>blown by the wind</em>”!, but if a new opportunity did come along, and one decided that that opportunity was for them, then I think <strong><em>one should commit to that fully</em></strong>!</p>

<h2 id="question-25">Question 25</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q25. What made the person you are today?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A25.</em></strong> I think I am just the <strong><em>product of all of their past experiences</em></strong>. Was it <strong>Chuck Palanuick</strong>, the American Novelist, who said, “<em>Nothing of me is original. I am the combined effort of everybody I have ever known</em>”</p>

<p>I personally think I’ve just been extremely lucky, to have worked, over the years, with some excellent <strong><em>friends</em></strong>, <strong><em>coaches</em></strong>, and <strong><em>mentors</em></strong>, who have instilled in me some great character!</p>

<p>I think this is just <strong><em>huge luck of the people I’ve experienced</em></strong>, which is why I think that <strong><em>meeting new people</em></strong>, and opening myself out to <strong><em>different experiences</em></strong> is critically important for my own <strong><em>personal development</em></strong>!</p>

<h2 id="question-26">Question 26</h2>
<p><strong><em>Q26. What is your definition of wealth and a successful life?</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>A26.</em></strong> I think there is no clear definition because it means <strong><em>different things to different people</em></strong>!</p>

<p>For some people, <strong><em>financial wealth</em></strong> is very important, not necessarily because they are materialistic - but because it might be that their <strong><em>family never had wealth</em></strong>, and this is one way they can achieve <strong><em>that level of psychological comfort</em></strong>.</p>

<p>(<strong><em>Financial security</em></strong> for me, because it’s something I’ve never had, or have struggled a lot with the past few years - leaving work to self-fund my MBA, then struggling to find work for almost a year after the Brexit vote happened, and then having to deal with large gaps in income between my freelance contracts and projects)</p>

<p>For other people, it might be <strong><em>with their career</em></strong>.</p>

<p>For others, it might be with their <strong><em>health and fitness</em></strong>, and so forth.</p>

<p>I think if there was a definition - it would be an <strong><em>intangible</em></strong> and <strong><em>general one</em></strong> - just to be <strong><em>happy</em></strong> and <strong><em>fulfilled</em></strong>, in what you do - to achieve everything and anything that you want and need, something to <strong><em>truly</em></strong> put your mind to! That will mean different things to different people!</p>

<p>I think, if you wake up and you feel, “<strong><em>I’m grateful and excited to have this day</em></strong>”, then that is a sign of success!</p>

<p>However, I think if you wake up and you think, “<strong><em>I just need to get through this day</em></strong>”, then that is a sign you might want to do something different.</p>

<p><strong>THE END</strong></p>
