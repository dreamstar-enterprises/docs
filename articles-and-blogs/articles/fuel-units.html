<p>It’s like what the Warren Buffet said “<strong><em>The more you learn the more you (have the potential) to earn</em></strong>”</p>

<p>Having a close mentor can change your life and can change your life forever! When you bump into one, you might find another, and then another, and before you know it, you might have 5! They can really show you the way!</p>

<p>It’s not just about the money (though some level of financial security is important)!</p>

<p>But when you were 10 year’s old, reading <strong><em>that book</em></strong>, dreaming that vision you had about the future, you were (even if you didn’t know it already) nurturing <strong><em>a passion</em></strong>! At that time, you had no money! (Your parents worked hard to try and take care of that, to take care of your upbringing, and of your education). Then, instead, it was all about the good life! About health, love, self-discovery, happiness!</p>

<p>Being able to dream is not a con, or a pipedream! People often say, if things sounds too good to be true, they usually are. But if you know the proven steps, and apply them in the right way, the dream you may still hold in your mind for yourself, for those around you, and the world, they can happen faster than you think!</p>

<h2 id="number-1">Number 1</h2>

<p><em>Invest in yourself!</em></p>

<h2 id="number-2">Number 2</h2>

<p><em>Always be curious!</em></p>

<h2 id="number-3">Number 3</h2>

<p><em>Don’t be a cynic!</em></p>

<p>Some people might read this and think, oh, that’s just like everything else.</p>

<p>But don’t listen! Don’t listen!</p>

<p>Always be an optimist!</p>

<p><strong>Conrad Hilton</strong>, the man who started Hilton Hotels, once said, that only at 15 yrs. old, he read a book by <strong>Helen Keller</strong>, and that booked changed his life! Books can change your life!</p>

<p>In that book, Helen Keller taught Conrad about, “<em>Optimism</em>”!</p>

<p>If you’re somebody who knows there is something better – the dream is possible. For some of your reading this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it’s a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it’s a new lifestyle, without so much stress! Maybe Travelling the world!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe it’s a life away from renting and buying something you can call your own!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Or maybe, it’s doing those things that you know you’re destined to do!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Money. I’d prefer to not call it money anymore, but “f<em>uel units</em>”. Well you must have enough “<em>fuel units</em>” to live out your dream and to live out your destinies – the things that are going to keep you motivated!</p>

<h2 id="number-4">Number 4</h2>

<p><em>Have Mentors and Imagine!</em></p>

<p>Just Imagine for a second, right now, today, how much more <strong>successful</strong> you might be, if you started a company, 50/50 with Bill Gates as your business partner, back in the 80s/ and 90s – and you both used every trick of the trade, that he used to build Microsoft into one of the biggest companies in the world.</p>

<p>Imagine how much money you’d have in your bank account, today, if say, Warren Buffett, was teaching you how to invest in the stock market… showing you what he used to build Berkshire Hathaway into a $140bn enterprise.</p>

<p>Imagine too how much <strong>happier</strong> you might be, today, if the Dalai Llama was your personal guide, showing you how to find fulfillment in life, in the little things, that most people overlook!</p>

<p>Imagine how much <strong>healthier</strong> you’d be, today, if when you woke up, you went down to your gym, and Arnold Schwarzenegger was waiting there, and that he was your personal trainer… showing you how to build your body into the most fit body ever.</p>

<p>Imagine the <strong>change you’d be making in the world</strong>, the <strong>injustice you’d be solving</strong>, today, if Mother Teresa and you were running a charity together, and she was showing you what she learnt on the streets of Calcutta, helping the poor, sick, and the dying.</p>

<p>Mentors have the power to <strong>do this</strong> in your life!</p>

<p>Everybody here recognizes the importance of a role model. Great people, great mentors, inspiring role models, have the ability to transform your life!</p>

<p><strong>When you were 16…</strong></p>

<p>Often in the world, everybody wants something, but not everyone gets what they want. Life is short! The sands of time can quickly slip by in your life.</p>

<p>It’s like the Dutch saying, “<em>We’re too soon old, too late smart</em>”.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs said, “<em>I didn’t want to be the richest man in the graveyard.</em>”</p>

<p>When you were 16, you may have asked yourself: “<em>What did I want to be when I grow up?</em>” For a lot of people, the answer to that question can be the truest version of themselves!</p>

<p>And the answer to that question might simply have been: “<em>I want to find the good life</em>”.</p>

<p>Aristotle talks about <strong>Eudemonia</strong> – his definition of the good life. “<em>Health, wealth and happiness… Love - all those things!</em>”</p>

<p>And then you might have thought</p>

<p>“<em>This is too hard! How am I ever going to figure this out? There are so many hard questions! I’m only 16, and I’ve got to figure out what college I want to go to, what religion I’m going to follow, who I’m going to marry, what politics to follow, where I should live, what career and path to pursue</em>”</p>

<p>Then you might have thought, well, I’ll just write a letter, to the smartest person I can think of. Say your grandfather, and ask him:</p>

<p>“<em>Grandfather, will you tell me how to design my life?</em>”</p>

<p>But then it might come back and say:</p>

<p>“<em>Sorry, Grandson, I can’t help you. The modern world is too complicated. You will never find all the answers from just one person. If you’re lucky, a handful of people along the way will point out the way</em>”</p>

<p>But in this, is a hint, you might not fully, initially, understand.</p>

<p>People often think that you have to go inward to find your truth.</p>

<p><strong>The truth however is that you have to go outward!</strong></p>

<p>If you can download the consciousness, the mindset, of people, who have gone before you, the smartest, the wisest, the most intelligent, the most experienced people, then you will get what you want!</p>

<p>What you might find out from your research, and from mentors, is that your ability to adapt, improve, and innovate is the biggest predictor of the success you will have!</p>

<p>As <strong>Picasso</strong> said, “<em>good artists copy! great artists adapt, improve and innovate!</em>”</p>

<p>It’s interesting. Did you know Albert Einstein had a mentor? Every Thursday, he would have lunch with a mentor growing up.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jay Z the rapper, he had a mentor.</li>
  <li>Opera Winfrey, said she had two mentors.</li>
  <li>Gandhi had a mentor.</li>
  <li>Alexander the great had Aristotle.</li>
  <li>Bill Gates had Paul Allen.</li>
  <li>Warren Buffet had Benjamin Graham.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is something here that most of us have missed out on.</p>

<h2 id="number-5">Number 5</h2>

<p><em>Follow the law of 33%!</em></p>

<p>Spend 33% of your time around people lower than you.</p>

<p>You can mentor them, and they’ll help you back by making you feel good about yourself.</p>

<p>Then you have 33% that are on your level. These become your friends! Your peers!</p>

<p>The last 33%, most people forget about. Those are people 10, 20 years ahead of you.</p>

<p>They will make you feel a little bit uncomfortable, but that’s what you want. Remember, you don’t want to make the mistake that others do when finding mentors - that is, the error of finding somebody just a little bit better than them. You don’t want to be the blind leading the blind.</p>

<p><strong>You need to find somebody 10 times further ahead than you!</strong></p>

<p>If you want to learn how to grow a £100m company, you have to find somebody who runs a £10bn company. <strong>Don’t be afraid to go to the top!</strong></p>

<p>In person mentors are amazing. You can get people like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.</p>

<p>You’d be surprised. If you write to people, you’ll be surprised how they might remember you. People remember their own struggle, and they might reach out, and help you too!</p>

<h2 id="number-6">Number 6</h2>

<p><em>Humility!</em></p>

<p>Sam Walton, used to be the richest man in America. He used to own Walmart. He used to take trips to Brazil, Sao Paulo. Once, when he was there, his host family got a call from the Police department. They said “<em>Come Bail out Sam Walton! He’s in jail.</em>”</p>

<p>He’s an old person, a billionaire. They rushed down. Now, if you’ve ever seen the inside of a Brazilian jail cell, it’s not a good place for a 60-year-old billionaire. They asked the police. “<em>Are you crazy, are you arresting him?</em>”</p>

<p>They said: “<em>We didn’t know who he was, and we found him crawling around on the floors of stores.</em>”</p>

<p>They asked him “<em>What are you doing?</em>”</p>

<p>He said, “<em>Oh, I was just taking a tape measure and measuring how wide the aisles were, because I was trying to figure out if these Brazilians knew something that I didn’t.</em>”</p>

<p>Already a billionaire! You’d think he’d be cocky. You see, everybody wants the good life, but not everybody is willing to be humble, like Sam Walton was. You have to be humble!</p>

<h2 id="number-7">Number 7</h2>

<p><em>Perseverance!</em></p>

<p>The media often plays tricks on us. They only show us the success at the end. But Bill Gates started at 12. It wasn’t until 31 yrs. old that he was a billionaire. He said from age 20 to age 30, he never took a day off. Not even one.</p>

<p>You must persevere, and in your search for mentors, you must persevere!</p>

<h2 id="number-8">Number 8</h2>

<p><em>Books!</em></p>

<p>Books are hidden treasures.</p>

<p>Mentors are great in person, but some of the great mentors are no longer alive. Shakespeare, Darwin, Freud, Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>If I told you all those people would be at my house this Saturday, answering questions, and that magically I could make that happen, would you show up at my house? Of course, everyone would buy a plane ticket and end up in London!</p>

<p><strong>The modern education system has turned people off from books!</strong></p>

<p>You’ve got to try and re-wire your mind.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t see a book like a one-time event. See a book like a friend. You read it over and over. You come back, and just like friends, you pick a handful of them.</strong></p>

<p>Find 150 books. There are 130 million. You can’t read that many, but 150 books, you can read over and over for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>There’s no rule either on how fast you have to read them. You can set your own pace. Maybe read a book a day. Sometimes, it might take week.</p>

<p>But sometimes, books only have one or two things that are worth reading.</p>

<p>In fact, most books only have that. So, you could flip through the pages initially. The first time read the table of contents, the back. The second time go a little fast. The third time, just focus on one chapter.</p>

<p>See yourself like a gold miner. Keep looking for that one nugget. Then put it back on the shelf.</p>

<h2 id="number-9">Number 9</h2>

<p><em>Stoic versus Epicurean</em></p>

<p>A nation is born stoic and dies epicurean.</p>

<p>Stoics are people willing, willing to sacrifice present pleasure for something better later. You could say they were investors.</p>

<p>Epicureans live for now. They are consumers. They say you only live once.</p>

<p>Luxury can come at a cost. It can come at the cost of ruining your hopes, your dreams, and your ambitions. So, instead, be a stoic!</p>

<p>When is the last time you went for a week without eating sugar, or walked instead of taking the car to get groceries, or did 100 pushups, or turned the air conditioning off?</p>

<p>Build resilience in yourself! Take a cold shower!</p>

<p>As Chief Tecumseh, the Native American Warrior, once said: “<strong><em>Love your life. Perfect your life. Beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long, and its purpose in the service of your people</em></strong>”</p>

<p>Find a mentor! Say Optimistic and have enough (Fuel Units!) to keep you motivated!</p>

<p>Even if you are experienced, there is always someone to learn from!</p>
