<p>A summary of article from the Institute of Directors on investing, by Thomas Hulme, now investor at Google Ventures, about widening your sources of inspiration.</p>

<h2 id="the-two-models">The Two Models</h2>

<p>Thomas observes that all businesses come in two shapes and sizes, or rather swing between two phases, those exploring new opportunities, and those that exploit old and known certainties. Those in the explorative phase experiment and learn fast. Those in the explorative phase value optimization more, and place a heavy hand on standardization and much lighter one on experimentation.</p>

<p>But is just moving from one type to another enough? He argues that because the world is changing so fast, that for a company that just focuses on exploitation, it might be too late, and why there needs to be a balance of both: <strong><em>invention of business</em></strong> and <strong><em>administration of business, originality and mastery</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Being both though is not easy as both need quite different approaches. Exploitative businesses, because of their deeply embedded cultures, systems, and processes, by design, eliminate variances and unpredictability. This is often because they benchmark themselves against their existing known competitive set, and other exploitative businesses, perhaps narrowing further to those of the same size.</p>

<p>His solution? Companies, when considering their competitive set, need to look wider (or widen their sources of inspiration), considering any organization - a start-up or multinational - and their ability to meet similar customer needs, and benchmark themselves against their ability to meet those needs.</p>

<p>They should really be inspired by those who can disrupt! Why disruptors? They are intensely focused and optimized on meeting customer needs. They have the ability to turn an incumbents perceived advantages into their <em>Achilles’ Heal</em>. As those taking the first explorative steps, they also typically reveal the direction in which an industry may be headed.</p>

<h2 id="examples-of-technology--media-disruptors">Examples of Technology &amp; Media Disruptors!</h2>

<p>Here are two examples he picks out from the technology, media and entertainment industry.</p>

<h3 id="1st-example---pop-idol">1st Example - Pop Idol</h3>

<p>A long time ago, the boss of a big record company would pay out expensive Artist and Repertoire (A&amp;R) fees to seek out bands to sign. Once signed, they could then reap significant cash rewards through a global system of retailers – benchmarking themselves against other labels using classic exploitative metrics (e.g. volume of sales, percentage of artists that go platinum). The exercise is useful, but can prevent companies from looking at disruptors for innovation until it is too late.</p>

<p>Out of nowhere, for example, Pop Idol sprang up with a highly disruptive business model. Here viewers paid to vote on the talent they liked. Pop Idol would sign a deal with the winner, promote the artist and organize live tours.</p>

<p>Pop Idol’s business model turns things on its head. Significant A&amp;R search costs are turned into revenue, risk is reduced by signing up proven talent (TV viewers have already made clear who they like to market). It also allows the talent to be acquired at low cost (terms are agreed in advance, usually, of any success), with creative ways to monetize talent beyond traditional music sales (through organised tours).</p>

<h3 id="2nd-example---netflix">2nd Example - Netflix</h3>

<p>His second example: He says that imagine you’re the head of a large video rental chain store. You have scale, negotiating power, brand recognition, real estate, and are intensely focused on efficiency and growth (classic exploitative phase metrics). You may not have noticed however that industry disruptors are turning your strengths into weaknesses. This is exactly what Netflix’s model did when it entered the market in 1997.</p>

<p>Netflix, like Pop Idol, challenged the business model. It turned the incumbents expensive retail channels into their Achilles heal through a different distribution mechanism. It then used the strengths of its own distribution channel to improve the customer experience, offering tailored recommendations, and greater movie choice and flexibility (at lower cost because of centralized stocking). It even smoothed demand by inviting customers to create a list of films they wanted to watch, and the company then chose the order in which they received them.</p>

<p>Here we can see that the success of Pop Idol showed us how accepted costs can be turned into revenues, and the value of the wisdom of the crowd. Netflix inspires us to question an incumbent’s greatest costs in their P&amp;L, to view every aspect of the business model through the eyes of the consumer (tailored recommendations, better choice), and to continually ask what technologies might allow their needs to be better met (smoothing demand). Both models show the requirement to look beyond the incumbent competitive set.</p>

<h2 id="key-lesson">Key Lesson?</h2>

<p>We are all trained to analyze a market’s incumbents. Why? Their demise attracts more attention than the rise of the disruptor. They’re also easier to find and benchmark. However, to build a business’s muscles to explore and exploit simultaneously, watching the disruptors in action, regardless of their size or industry, is key to any business’s long-term success.</p>
