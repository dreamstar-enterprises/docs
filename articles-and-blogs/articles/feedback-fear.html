<p>Whether you work in HR, or it’s that time of the year of to give formal appraisals and assessments, or you want to need to give informal feedback, here are some useful tips on how you can take some of the fear out of the process, to maintain a friendly, and collaborative work environment.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-feedback-scary">Why is feedback scary?</h2>

<p>Giving and receiving feedback can be scary. For most of us, “<em>feedback</em>” can be synonymous with “<em>criticism</em>” and carries with it negative connotations. And, as humans, we tend to be hard-wired to avoid what we feel to be uncomfortable situations.</p>

<p>At worst, our brains tell us there couldn’t be anything more uncomfortable than telling a colleague something negative, or hearing criticism about ourselves. At best, we fear the awkwardness of having an honest conversation with the people we work with.</p>

<p>But you shouldn’t be scared, or put off by it. Feedback, when done right, can be hugely positive, beneficial and, most importantly, not an intimidating experience.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-do-feedback-the-right-way">How to do feedback the right way?</h2>

<p>Feedback is integral to a friendly, and collaborative work environment. It can change our interactions for the better and make us happier overall. Though it can be scary, here are some tips that can help it feel less daunting.</p>

<h3 id="make-your-intentions-positive">Make your intentions positive</h3>

<p>The most important thing to remember about feedback is that it should always come from a good place, i.e. wanting to help another person. This could mean anything from wanting to support their career to wanting to show them an alternative way to approach a problem. If everyone in the conversation is aware of the good intentions behind the feedback, both giving and receiving, it becomes much less daunting.</p>

<h3 id="keep-to-a-structure">Keep to a structure</h3>

<p>Following a good structure, when giving feedback, can help reduce the anxiety you might have around the best way to deliver your thoughts. Whatsmore, if ask for any feedback you receive to follow a specific form, it can alleviate any worries you might have about being caught off guard with unhelpful comments.</p>

<p>There are a few different models you can choose from to structure your feedback. Here are some of them.</p>

<p><strong>1. PAID model</strong></p>

<p>To follow the PAID model you need to make sure each piece of feedback given has the following elements:</p>

<h4 id="p--positive-intent">P – Positive intent</h4>

<p>Make sure you understand why you are giving this feedback? Make sure it’s for the right reasons, to help the other person, rather than to get something off your chest.</p>

<h4 id="a--action">A – Action</h4>

<p>Think about what have you observed about the person? Make sure it’s specific; instead of “you’re always late,” you could say, “you were late to the last three meetings I hosted.”</p>

<h4 id="i--impact">I – Impact</h4>

<p>Think about what effect their action had on either you or the business? In the case of our late person, you could say, “when you’re late, it makes me feel like you don’t care about what I have to say.”</p>

<h4 id="d--desired-outcome">D – Desired outcome</h4>

<p>Then, think about what could the person do next time to improve? Offer your suggestions without being too forceful – and tell them that they are just your ideas.</p>

<p>Giving feedback in this way makes the overall process much more sincere, and much more impactful.</p>

<p><strong>2. Stop, start, continue</strong></p>

<p>Another model is Stop, Start, and Continue. It does what it says on the tin: you tell someone what they should stop doing, then what they should start doing, and finally what they should continue doing. This system is great because it’s balanced and not personal, meaning there’s less opportunity for the conversation to turn awkward.</p>

<p><strong>3. Did well, could improve, how I could help you</strong></p>

<p>Here, tell someone something they do well, something they could do to improve, and something you could do better yourself to support them. You can either use this looking back at a project, or specific piece of work, or use it to give ongoing feedback.</p>

<p>The words you use are important here. By suggesting an “improvement” you’re not criticising or saying they did something wrong, you’re simply offering something additional they could do to make things even better. This will help take any discomfort out of the interaction.</p>

<p>Including the final point will help transform the conversation from a potentially awkward ‘confrontation’ to an open, honest chat, with both parties discussing things they could do to improve.</p>

<h3 id="make-it-face-to-face">Make it face to face</h3>

<p>As tempting as it may be to rattle off a quick email, feedback really should be done face to face. When something’s written down, it can easily be misinterpreted, which can create tension. Plus, you have the added fear of having to wait for the other person’s response. It’s much better to have a casual chat. It doesn’t have to be a big deal though – no big, scary meetings here. Just pop time in your colleagues’ diary and have a chat over a hot drink.</p>

<h2 id="quick-tips-for-dealing-with-feedback-fear">Quick tips for dealing with feedback fear</h2>

<p>In case you’re still feeling a little nervous, here are some quick-fire tips to help calm feedback-related nerves:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be specific</li>
  <li>Feedback should never be general or personal. Focus on specific problems and solutions.</li>
  <li>Timing is everything</li>
  <li>Don’t respond to an issue in the heat of the moment – or six months later, when everyone’s forgotten about it.</li>
  <li>Be yourself</li>
  <li>When something doesn’t feel right, call it how you see it. It’s good to trust your instincts.</li>
  <li>Think of it like a conversation</li>
  <li>The main objective of feedback is to understand one another. Treat it the way you would treat any other professional conversation.</li>
  <li>Focus on the good as much as the bad</li>
  <li>It’s easy to be too critical of yourself. Make sure you pay attention to all the positive feedback, too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sharing feedback can have a really great effect on your working environment and your relationships with our colleagues. It can be scary, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
