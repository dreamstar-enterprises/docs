<h2 id="dont-compare-1">Don’t compare</h2>

<p>Charlie Munger, the successful American businessman, investor, and now philanthropist, once said “<em>Envy is a really stupid sin, because it is the</em> <strong><em>one thing</em></strong> <em>you could never possibly have any fun at. There is a lot of pain, and no fun</em>”. Yet how often do we end up comparing ourselves to others?</p>

<p>These others can be friends, family, work colleagues, or acquaintances. If you ever wished you had something, that someone else has, and which you don’t, then you are probably falling into the trap of envy!</p>

<p>What is the solution? Mind your own business! Don’t compare yourself to others. Instead compare yourself to how you were the day before. Focus on your own progress. And if you happen to be surrounded by successful members of society, then wire yourself to cheer for them.</p>

<p>Look at the alternative! Would you rather be surrounded by failures? Probably not! You are the average of the five people you hang out with. Or as Chuck Palanuick, the American Novelist once said “Nothing of me is orginal. I am just the combined effort of everyone I’ve ever had the good fortune to meet”.</p>

<p>So, if you’re the smartest person in the room, then you are in trouble. Don’t compare!</p>

<h2 id="your-time-is-limited">Your Time Is Limited</h2>

<p>It sounds quite morbid to talk about how everyday might be your last day, but doing so can be very liberating! Because once you acknowledge that your time is limited, that is when you will start focusing on the things that really matter. When you see every day as gifting you another day, you will naturally home in on those people, projects, and activities that make the journey worth taking.</p>

<p>Of course, if you have aspirations and ambitions, (and I think everyone does), then there will be a destination that you would like to reach. You will want to get to the peak, extend your arms wide open, close your eyes, breath in your achievement, and let the euphoria of success wash all over you.</p>

<p>But this moment is just that, a moment! It may have taken you years to get to that peak. But then, as you look over the mountain, you identify another mountain, - a slightly higher one – on another horizon, and that makes the journey worth taking again.</p>

<p>If you look at each day as your last, a term that the Stoics (those people who endure pain or hardship without showing their feelings or complaining), call Momento Mori, then no matter where your journey ends, it will have been a life worth taking!</p>

<h2 id="reality-doesnt-care">Reality doesn’t care</h2>

<p>Nothing is good or bad, but our thinking makes it so. How you interpret the situation you are in, your relationships, or life, depends on the prism through which you see it.</p>

<p>You can either choose to judge reality and attach a label to it (“<em>oh that was a good day</em>”, “<em>life is bit crummy right now</em>”, “<em>we have been struggling</em>”), OR you can choose to attach no label to it (“<em>it is what it is</em>”, “<em>I am ok with whatever comes my way</em>”).</p>

<p>Now, does reality change because of the label you attach to it? No! Reality does not care!
What changes though is how you feel about reality! If this is the case, wouldn’t you want to feel good about everything that happens to you?</p>

<p>Of course, you would! It is called <strong><em>Amor Fati</em></strong>. – or a love of Fate! A love of everything that happens to you, irrespective of whether it is good or bad.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-control">What you Control</h2>

<p>One of the most important concepts you can learn in life is that of <em>Control</em>!</p>

<p>There are certain things that are in your control. And there are other things that are NOT in your control. Your own thoughts, for example, are in your control! So are your actions arising from those thoughts. However, how other people think and act, well, that is something outside your control.</p>

<p>If you balance or try to soften and tame your expectations with this concept of Control, and what can and cannot control, then you will be much happier and calmer.</p>

<p>Although you may always try to influence others to get what you desire, regardless of the outcome, your state of mind or mood will not be held hostage to it. In fact, most of the miseries that people encounter, usually has to do with HOW they wish others WERE, or HOW they wish and expect others to BEHAVE – aspects that are totally outside their CIRCLE OF CONTROL. As a result, just like a weather, there mood will always sway like a manic-depressive character, from a cartoon.</p>

<p>The solution. Stop wishing your friend, parent, partner, sibling, or stranger behave in the certain ways that you expect them to. Instead, focus only on what is in your control, and do this by acting with: respect, kindness, generosity, and calmness, - without wishing that everyone fit your own “<em>idea of ideal</em>” in the world.</p>

<h2 id="be-aware-of-your-uncertainty">Be aware of your uncertainty</h2>

<p>Everyone feels uncertain. Everyone! What you may feel uncertain about could be very different to what I feel uncertain about me, but “uncertainty” always plays a role in day to day life.</p>

<p>If you are striving to achieve anything, then the possibility that it might not work out, results in uncertainty. The question however is, how do you respond to that feeling?</p>

<p>Do you react impulsively to calm your nerves? Do you journal your thoughts down on paper, and get your monkey mind off your back? Or do you sit, and think through your thoughts in your own mind, as a way of trying to detach yourself from this feeling?</p>

<p>Journaling is always a good strategy!</p>

<p>When you get your thoughts down onto another medium, such a paper, you can see your writing on paper. You can edit your uncertainty! You can even add to the story if you like, and if it still makes sense to you. It’s an exercise that be very relieving and therapeutic!</p>

<p>Another good strategy is to just observe your uncertainty as if you are a third person. This too will enable you to detach from this feeling as well.</p>

<p>Lastly, thinking about what is in your control, and what is not, and what is just being driven by the vicissitudes of daily life, will allow you to find joy in the journey, instead of obsessing about the destination.</p>

<h2 id="be-patient">Be Patient</h2>

<p>What is patience? It is the ability to wait without tiring of waiting! It is a very subtle dance that you need to play between pushing for progress, and waiting for progress to happen.</p>

<p>Often emotions get the better of us because we want something to happen very badly. But because someone is on the other end of that expectation, if you become too pushy, you might upset that person.</p>

<p>In moments like these it is best to just listen to whatever signs the other person might be giving you. Put your expectations to the side, and closely listen to what that person actually wants. It might not be the same as what you want, but more often than not, it is a mutual game of compromising, and finding a balance between the two. The results will play out in due course - provided you’re patient!</p>

<h2 id="write-first-thing-on-waking-up">Write first thing on waking up</h2>

<p>Before you pick up your phone, or talk to anyone, open your journal of thoughts and write!</p>

<p>When you wake up, your mind will be flooded with thoughts! You want to capture those, and properly incorporate and articulate those into your thinking.</p>

<p>The early hours of the morning can be the best time of the day to find solutions or let the subconscious talk into the conscious.</p>

<p>How you are feeling, why you are feeling that way, what might be bothering you or concerning you, what you are happy about, what you are looking forward to, other random stuff, all of it will come pouring out!</p>

<p>Once you type it out or put pen to paper, there is a level of comfort automatically settles in. You start acting from a place of clear knowledge, and rationalism, instead of reacting from a place of fuzzy feelings.</p>

<p>When you write your stream of consciousness – the knowledge of what is really going on up there, in your mind, that is something that is both powerful and liberating! So, give it a go!</p>

<h2 id="be-self-aware">Be self-aware</h2>

<p>The monologue inside your skull will never stop!</p>

<p>You are constantly talking to yourself. You are thinking thoughts. You are constantly asking and connecting one question to another. You are brainstorming ideas. You go down one rabbit hole, only to come out of another. It can be chaotic in there.</p>

<p>To bring order to all this chaos, you need to be self-aware! You need to know exactly what is going inside your head! This may sometimes mean needing to zoom out and look at yourself as a separate entity.</p>

<p>Observe your own behaviour. Get to the root cause of why you think the way you do. Try to work out why you do things the way you do. What in-built rule or rules are driving your thoughts and actions?</p>

<p>Journaling can help in the process. And if you want “<em>aha-moments</em>”, journal these down first thing in the morning. Let your stream of consciousness give you answers that seem like a puzzle!</p>

<p>Be self-aware!</p>

<h2 id="switch-off-by-leaving-your-phone-behind">Switch off by leaving your phone behind!</h2>

<p>Our lives are dominated with work, day-in and day-out, everyday!</p>

<p>When you actually want to hit pause, it can be extremely difficult. There is this compulsion to keep on working. You can end up spending all of your time checking emails, or WhatsApp messages, or Slack, or LinkedIn, or Facebook, even when you should be taking a proper rest break, and giving your mind and body a rest.</p>

<p>This is why Holidays might not always really be Holidays. You might have transported yourself to a beautiful location, but your mind has still never really left that “<em>To-do</em>” list behind.</p>

<p>If you carry your phone with you, you will always be tempted to do what you do every day, when you have your phone with you, constantly checking it, and just not being able to stop.</p>

<p>Solution? Leave that phone behind, as you ski down the mountain, or walk to the beach. Experience the sunset, uninterrupted, in all its glory! Push your arms wide open and feel the cool breeze wash over your face. Take in a deep breath of fresh, re-juvenating air. Let someone else try to capture the moment on their phones. Let yourself be the one actually experiencing the moment, as it is, instead!</p>

<h2 id="have-proactive-rituals">Have Proactive Rituals</h2>

<p>What do you do when you wake up? What do you do after you visit the washroom? What about before you talk to anyone? Or after you pick up your phone? Before you work? After work? During work?</p>

<p>Habits when done for long enough become rituals, and these rituals are important. They provide the grounding around which you can centre and build your day. They give you comfort and a sense of inner peace, as your unconscious mind goes through them - so that the other part of your mind - your conscious mind - can think about ways of making progress.</p>

<p>Are your rituals proactive or reactive? Do you wake up and journal your thoughts first thing in the morning, to tap and decode what’s going on in your subconscious mind? Do you read before you speak to family? If the first thing you do is respond to messages and phone calls, that means that the outside world is telling you what you should be doing and thinking about – you are living your life by someone else’s clock (rather than your own true compass!) As a result, you lose control of your own agenda, instead of being the one who decides how YOU spend your most precious asset, your OWN TIME.</p>

<p>So, WAKE YOURSELF up in the morning, and START YOUR DAY, with proactive rituals, because if you can do this, and do this well - day in and day out - then you will increase the possibility of: winning the morning, and winning the day! At the very least, you will be able to deal with the reactive stuff, including the things you cannot control - with more stability and care!</p>

<h2 id="have-a-purpose">Have a Purpose</h2>

<p>You need to live for something. You need to keep making progress.</p>

<p>Right now, this might be about your career. But as you age, it could become about building a family. When you have enough money to live financially independently, it could be about coaching your favourite sport, or building art, or writing or teaching or building and growing a business that makes products and services that you care and are deeply passionate about!</p>

<p>Whatever it is that rocks your boat, you need to keep on working at it! You need to have a purpose! Without that purpose and focus, you will feel lost, and will find yourself drifting from day to day. Time will slow down to the point that you will feel retired from life. You will try to fill that idle space with distractions, drugs and impulsiveness, which will make you feel good in the short term, but miserable in the long run.</p>

<p>The guiding light always should be that of purpose! And, as the Bhagawad Gita says “<em>Set thy heart upon thy work, but never on its reward. Work not for the reward; but never cease to do thy work.</em>”</p>

<h2 id="work-for-progress">Work for Progress</h2>

<p>Progress is the name of the game. Making that inch of advance. Getting closer to the destination. Talking to one more person. Dealing with one more client. Working out one more day. Writing one more post. It is all progress!</p>

<p>Those tiny decisions you make today will pile onto all the other tiny decisions you have made every other day, to have a powerful cumulative effect, that it will shape your life over time. Drop by drop you can get to the tipping point of a flood, which is in your favour!</p>

<p>So work for progress!</p>

<p>We are not made to be sedentary. Sitting on our “asses” for hours on end seems to be the norm of the modern day, however. It is the nature of the intellectual work which drives the world. We need computers. Computers need desks. We sit at our desks to work on our computers. Days, weeks, months and years pass by, with us hunching. Slowly back pain creeps in. Muscles atrophy. Health starts ringing alarm bells.</p>

<p>A simple solution to a lot of this is to get standing desks. Sit when you get tired, but getting physically tired – everyday - should be a goal! You should get home feeling not only mentally exhausted, but physically wanting a rest. A standing desk will make you move more. You will get more steps in. Your posture will be better. And you will sleep better too.</p>

<h2 id="have-to-work">Have to Work!</h2>

<p>No matter how much money you make, you have to work! It is the antidote to insanity. Let us assume you reach a point of reaching financial freedom. You have worked hard enough and long enough to be able to reach a point in your life where working just for money is not your objective. It is not required.</p>

<p>What then? Do you retire? Is the vision of utopia you have one in which you sit on the beach and sip on Pina Coladas all day? That will last a week before you go nuts lying on your ass!</p>

<p>You need to put your mind to do bigger and better things. You have to work irrespective of the money equation in your life. There is no shortcut to making progress and doing things, teaching and learning. Having a purpose s necessary, so is having the need to do satisfying and fulfilling work.</p>
