<p>Aside from acquiring new knowledge and learning new skills, a big focus of an MBA programme is on developing ones leadership confidence, and there are plenty of opportunities to learn and practice this.</p>

<p>Early on in my MBA programme, for example, we attended a comprehensive lecture series on leadership delivered by the business school’s leadership professor, <em>Robin Martin</em>. These classes gave taught me a lot about leadership: the practices and theories of leadership, (personality traits and skills of a leader); dimensional models of leadership behaviour (task, relationship, change-oriented); and different styles of leadership (situational, participative and transformational). We learnt a lot too from cases on bad leadership and leadership gone wrong.</p>

<p>It was inspiring too to listen to the views of business leaders on the topic every week in our first term. These included talks from: <em>Andy Stewart</em> from <em>HSBC</em>, who emphasized the importance of creating and fostering long term relationships; <em>Emma Fitzgerald</em> from <em>Shell</em>, whose experiences in China stressed the importance of keeping an open mind in new environments (especially, where the cultural shifts can be quite stark); and <em>John Lovering</em>, ex-Chairman of <em>Debenhams</em>, who said, instead of trying to do things too differently, identify your employees’ key competencies and focus on helping them improve those.</p>

<p>Combining these lessons with my own first hand experiences of leadership, from the MBA and before, here are some of my own views on what I think it takes to make a great business leader!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-your-leadership-principles">What are your leadership principles?</h2>

<p>Firstly, leadership is a selfless act. It comes from doing what you believe is the right thing – not for you, but for others in an organization – to achieve a greater good!</p>

<p>Having the right mindset and attitude is also important, as ultimately, these are the traits that will help enable and motivate others to perform to their best abilities.</p>

<p>Other qualities of a strong leader include having an open mind, tenacity, an (insatiable!) desire to learn, and unending ability and optimism to see how things could be done better.</p>

<h2 id="in-organisations-today-can-or-do-people-lead-or-manage">In organisations today, can or do people lead or manage?</h2>

<p>In some ways people can do both – but how much of either depends. The sheer size, complexity, and pace of change in today’s organisations, however, means that trying to obtain complete control is seldom achievable. Rather than obsess over total management and control, a strong leader will instead lead through example, raising the bar of what is, or was previously thought, possible. If done well, others will then follow…</p>

<h2 id="a-leader-leads-but-what-else-does-a-leader-need">A leader leads, but what else does a leader need?</h2>

<p>Strong leadership means being able to select and surround yourself by the right people – enthusiastic and experienced individuals, who in their own fields have become world experts in their own right. As business school students, whilst we might not have been world experts, we did see and appreciate aspects of this selection behavior in how we selected for our project teams - to ensure there was a diversity of skills, and breadth and depth of experience.</p>

<p>Having a team with the right blend of backgrounds, cultures and intellect, truly helps, as is having people who are unafraid to challenge ideas and initiatives, those who can provide a different perspective - even if slightly controversial!</p>

<p>Leaders also need a well-developed <em>value system</em> – one that connects with everyone in and outside the organisation, not just those at the top.</p>

<p>In business, this means making concerted efforts to truly understanding your customers – their needs, how they make decisions, the pressures they are under, and constant daily trade-offs they have to make. Only by connecting directly with your customers, and having empathy with them can you really deliver the best products and services.</p>

<p>This also means having a strong commitment to your employees - ensuring they have an enjoyable and safe place to work, plenty of opportunities to develop, and a system where they can be fairly remunerated.</p>

<p>Finally, it also means giving back to the wider community, so that you can earn the right to participate in the business of that community.</p>

<p>When times are tough, and difficult decisions have to be made (encountered plentiful times during our MBA), a written guideline, policy, or process will only help get people so far. Everyone – both employees and leaders – need to share a genuine belief in a strong value system, backed by a strong commitment and understanding of their customers, employees, and the communities in which they participate.</p>

<h2 id="are-past-credentials-important">Are past credentials important?</h2>

<p>How you use and take advantage of the skills you have learnt is probably what really matters. It shouldn’t really matter if you’re an engineer, a trained classicist, historian, mathematician by background. If you want to be a General Manager or Senior Executive, having a blend of many skills is important.</p>

<p>Coming from a technical background myself, I had the good fortune of also being able to take some humanities classes when I was an undergraduate, which gave me a different perspective.</p>

<p>For my MBA, my prior <strong>harder</strong> skills in engineering, finance and accounting were useful for courses such as <em>Statistics</em>, <em>Corporate Finance</em>, <em>Management</em> and <em>Financial Accounting</em> (still essential skills because they have allowed me to be engaged enough with others to be able to ask the right questions).</p>

<p>But the most challenging parts were probably with applying my <strong>softer</strong> skills – how to most effectively connect the dots, and most actively engage with people and teams to get the best out of them. These softer skills are especially important when needing to take an idea forward – and likely one of my most important MBA takeaways.</p>

<h2 id="any-other-leadership-lessons">Any other leadership lessons?</h2>

<p>Maintaining the right frame of mind and working with a positive attitude is always a challenge – not in any kind of arrogant or bullish way - but with the self-belief and confidence that any situation, regardless of how overwhelming it might initially seem, can be overcome with effective teamwork, encouragement, guidance and leadership.</p>

<p>Dwelling on problems, or writing beautifully lyrical PowerPoints is one thing (important still in certain contexts), but making actual progress in tough situations, depends a lot on being able to engage with people with a positive and clear frame of mind.</p>

<p>Related to this, another important lesson I would say is never to confuse education with intelligence.</p>

<p>In my career, I have worked and met with many people, many of whom I would call ‘<em>shockingly smart</em>’. These people never got the chance to go on into further education, and they were often the first in their family to go to high school, - but they were well trained, always a delight to work with, and very professional and bright in their own special way.</p>

<p>At the same time, I’ve worked with many people, with a lot of initials after their name, who perhaps cannot always ‘connect the dots’ as quickly as others. So, not confusing the two - intelligence and education - is another crucial lesson.</p>

<p>Lastly, recognising the humility to leadership is important. Before you try to assert any type of leadership onto others, you should be mindful of their own past experiences and ambitions - because, again, leadership is never about you alone, it is a selfless act, in trying to help others and the organisation in which you work.</p>

<h2 id="whats-needed-for-a-rewarding-and-successful-career">What’s needed for a rewarding and successful career?</h2>

<p>Having a customer-facing role is important. It gives you an insight into what is really important to them, and they are one of the most important stakeholders.</p>

<p>The other is how to effectively lead teams. Often, it is not an ‘<em>intellectual gap</em>’ that inhibits a person’s ability to succeed, but a lack of leadership skills, a lack of understanding, and lack of confidence in their own ability to use their capabilities and skill to make the people they work with (their team) even better!</p>

<p>Another is not to be too cautious! People, midway through their careers, can sometimes try to be a little bit too cagey or savvy in trying to make their careers ‘<em>just right</em>’. Instead, people should try to get as many different experiences as they can, so that they can perform well in both good markets and bad markets - even different geography markets! These are the kind of people who should be running towards turnaround situations, not away from them!</p>

<p>You might want to walk into a good situation, but if everything is going too well, it is tough to ‘<em>rock the boat</em>’! When things are in turmoil, and this is recognized as such by others, you can step in and really make a difference. In good situations, the challenge is to give greater thrust to make it even better.</p>

<p>A rewarding career also means having an unquenchable thirst and desire to learn more. The half-life of information today is so short (about 28 months) that the most important thing is often one’s desire, attitude and ability to learn! People shouldn’t just accept things for the way they are, but have a continuous ability to change and adapt. That is what brings both happiness, (peace of mind!) and success!</p>
