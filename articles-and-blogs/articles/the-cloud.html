<h2 id="customer-centricity">Customer Centricity</h2>

<p>Analytics and Technology providers are all changing their organization to be more customer centric – so that they really understand, from the customer’s point of view, what journey they’re trying to make.</p>

<p>These companies are trying to understand, fundamentally, what solutions will enable these journeys, and how they can build the best capabilities, not just products, that will support customers on these journeys.</p>

<h2 id="solutions-to-problems">Solutions to Problems</h2>

<p>Everybody looks at technology through different lenses, but at its core, it’s all about looking for “<em>solutions to problems</em>”. Company executives, across industries, want solutions to problems, and these problems can vary by industry. Taking the example of A.I., Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing, for instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Retailer might ask, “<em>How can I do</em> <strong><em>one</em></strong> <em>day shipping better?</em>” “<em>How can I help people order at home and pick up at the store?</em>” “<em>How do I do inventory planning better?</em>”</li>
  <li>If you’re talking to Financial Institutions, they might ask, “<em>Are there better solutions to do ‘fraud detection’, or ‘anti-money laundering’?</em>”.</li>
  <li>If you talk to logistics and manufacturing companies, they may ask “<em>How can I optimize the location of my fleet? How can I save money doing that better?</em>”, “<em>How can I do scheduling better?</em>”</li>
</ul>

<p>Because there are so many different examples of actual business problems technology can solve, it becomes all the more important to attentively listen to your customers, to really understand their needs, and then, if you need to, work with the set of partners to come up with solutions to these industry problems.</p>

<h2 id="magic-moments">Magic Moments!</h2>

<p>To succeed, you need to create that “<strong><em>magic moment</em></strong>”. Every business wants to create that “<em>magic moment”</em> with their customer, and there are many examples of where this could happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It could be when you order at home and you drive into the retailer, the retailer brings all your stuff, right up to you, to the curbside.</li>
  <li>It could be that they find you a product that you thought you couldn’t find.</li>
  <li>It could be that you imagine an experience you’ve had, you take a picture of it, and the hotel or the retailer then finds that experience for you!</li>
  <li>In the old days, when people went to a bank, they probably knew who the banker was in their local town. These days, financial institutions still want to create that personalized experience, but now use technology, more and more, sp they can meet the growth demand and scale challenges they have.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="culture-of-customer-experience">Culture of Customer Experience</h2>

<p>Being able to create an experience for your customers, where every customer feels the company that is selling or marketing to them, knows them personally, and wants to help them make the right decision - is super important!</p>

<p>You may already have a great technology foundation in place, or already have a great heritage for building great products, but you’ll do even better if you put the experience your customers get, at the very front!</p>

<p>So, if you try to be the best organization, in terms of understanding your customer’s needs, and can provide them with superior product capability, and match the expertise you have, with a real empathy with what they’re facing – you’ll likely do very well!</p>

<p>Achieving this will partly be about encouraging your employees to step forward. Getting them to embrace and understand that the customer is really important, and getting them to enjoy working with customers. If you do this, it can be a real pleasure and privilege to watch your organization mature in this way.</p>

<p>In large organizations, particularly one that might be growing, there are only a few themes that can realistically permeate throughout. If culturally, you can put the “<em>customer centricity</em>” and “<em>customer empathy</em>” at the centre, but also give your employees the freedom to apply their creativity to solving problems for your customers, then these themes will likely permeate and affect every part of the organisation.</p>

<p>For example, from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How your customer service organization answers a question when a customer has an issue they want resolved.</li>
  <li>How your engineers might talk to customers to understand what needs they have in the product roadmap.</li>
  <li>How your solution architects might understand the footprint of your customer when designing a solution for them, to</li>
  <li>How you might work with and bring in new partners, that share the same aspiration towards your customers.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="evolution-of-cloud--digital-analytics">Evolution of Cloud &amp; Digital Analytics</h2>

<p>Most technology providers today, know that “<em>The Cloud</em>” and “<em>Digital analytics</em>” are seen very differently from how they were a few years ago.</p>

<p>For example, if you go back to 2000 to 2006, and talked to people about “<em>The Cloud</em>”, they largely saw it as a simple service offering. In fact, the word “<em>Cloud</em>” didn’t even exist back then. It was known as application software as a service (SAAS).</p>

<p>A lot of the value that people talked about then was actually <strong><em>convenience</em></strong> - that instead of getting on-premise software that you had to install and manage, and upgrade - you got a browser, and your users got access through the browser.</p>

<p>The second phase with “<em>The Cloud</em>” then came between 2005/6 to 2015, when people talked about the value that it would give in terms of <strong><em>economic efficiency</em></strong>, and superior <strong><em>cost economics</em></strong>, for example, by saying, “<em>Don’t run your own data centres, put your data in our data centres, and we’ll run all storage and processing for you, more economically</em>”.</p>

<p>Now, we are now entering a new phase, which is really about what kind of <strong><em>new capability</em></strong> can “<em>The Cloud</em>” and “<em>Digital Analytics</em>” provide, that people cannot solve in other ways. Or, are there other technology and solutions you can offer that people cannot do in any other way.</p>

<p>So, these days, when customers talk to technology providers, that’s the primary thing that they’re discussing. There’s certainly talk about what can be done <strong><em>more conveniently</em></strong>, how do you <strong><em>save money</em></strong> – and all that - but a lot of the conversations are now about “<em>can you help me with this business problem, can you help me break through something that I couldn’t do before</em>”. And these are a lot of the conversations that are happening now are accelerating.</p>

<p>This is probably the biggest shift going forward.</p>

<h2 id="solutions-not-products-or-capabilities">Solutions, not Products or Capabilities!</h2>

<p>Providing solutions to problems is absolutely key! Telling a customer, “<em>here is a set of capabilities or products, and you go off an assemble that into a solution</em>”, that can be very challenging for companies and people!</p>

<p>As a practical example, many people today talk about A.I. and M.L.. But there’s actually a huge shortage of people in the industry that can do A.I., and do A.I. well.</p>

<p>Now, many organizations have contact centres - Hospitals have them, Retailers have them, Financial institutions have them, Hotels have them, Communication companies have them. And, if you’re talking about wanting to create that “<strong><em>magic moment</em></strong>” for your customer, then if you’re being really honest with yourself, 99% of the engagement that customers get after the initial purchase is actually through the contact centre!</p>

<p>But then, going ahead and telling people, “<em>Hey, there are technologies like speech to text, translation, all of these things, why don’t you hire a hundred data scientists and build a solution to improve contact centres</em>”. That’s very challenging for companies because there’s a scarcity of talents.</p>

<p>Instead, you should create complete “<em>solutions</em>” that can help companies directly improve the experience their consumers have. Customers can then call the contact centre without them having to hire an army of people and expertise themselves.</p>

<p>Many organizations just need to be bold and to be brave in accepting technology change, because it is happening fast. They can do this by partnering with technology providers, who can provide them with the right solutions, so that in the face of this accelerating technology change, they don’t freeze or feel afraid of embracing the technology.</p>

<p>On the other side, as a technology provider, you need to recognise what aspirations the company, or their customers have, and what’s the best solution to supporting them in reaching that aspiration. Sometimes, in fact, oftentimes, it’s not about a product, but about a solution, because the solution itself can simplify their ability to reach that aspiration, which may mean not having to hire all the people they might need, etc.</p>

<h2 id="analytics-and-cloud-in-retail--manufacturing">Analytics and Cloud in Retail &amp; Manufacturing!</h2>

<p>As a practical industry example, when it comes to wanting better Digital Analytics and Cloud Service offerings, lots of retailers these days say “<em>Hey I’d like to compete with pure e-commerce vendors, by being able to ship from my store directly to the customer’s home, because I’d like to do same-day delivery</em>”.</p>

<p>That in itself is a very powerful customer facing value proposition. The challenge, however, that it creates is that every store then becomes a mini warehouse, which means that every store then becomes a point of inventory. So, now, your inventory management systems, and inventory planning, and demand forecasting systems, which historically would have been considered a back-office thing, and where you might have been used to planning across 50 warehouses in North America, now, you have got a plan across 5,000 retail stores!</p>

<p>Consequently, between what a customer facing function and what a back-office function is - that is also increasingly, becoming less and less relevant - because of the nature of demands from consumers, and the imperative for an organization to get competitive advantage and differentiate.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration-is-key">Collaboration is key!</h2>

<p>When it comes to technology, the technology platforms that win in the end, are usually those that are differentiated not just by the vendors’ own solutions, but by the ecosystem of solutions that are available on that platform.</p>

<p>So, in this respect, defining a clear partner program is very important – one that spans across enough partners. It doesn’t have to be just distributors and resellers, or system integrators, it can also be solution providers, or managed services companies. But ensuring that you’re clear with the partners you’re engaging with, on where you plan to offer solutions, and where they complement you, is very important.</p>

<p>Also, if you’re not a services company, but a product and solutions company then – to your partner say so! You might, for example, have a very small services arm, but whose primary work is around some very advanced areas like A.I. and Machine Learning that need to be proven out, on the cutting edge, before they are made available to partners.</p>

<h2 id="business-optimisation-vs-business-process-re-implementation">Business Optimisation vs Business Process Re-implementation</h2>

<p>Technology and Digital Analytics providers like to think of themselves as business optimisers. They will often tell customers, therefore, to keep the business process layer as is – (reimplementing entire business process layers can be extraordinary challenging. It can be many years and many, you know, cycles to replace that).</p>

<p>Instead the trend has been to extract from the business process layer - the data, and do the due analytics, and optimization, and feed that back in. This is the value they provide.</p>

<p>For example, many, many of the top retailers in the world need help with supply chain, inventory planning, and optimization – driven strongly by the retailer’s desire to improve product cycles and have faster product cycles. Compounded to this is the fact that there are also many, many more points in which retailers are maintaining inventory, because now, each store, is a point of inventory.</p>

<p>These two factors have made demand planning processes, that now try to tie many more SKUs, which now have shorter life cycles, with many more points of inventory, much more complex. This often leads to a very expensive cost of inventory.</p>

<p>This is why as an Analytics or Cloud Solutions provider, you shouldn’t really be telling your customers to replace their current supply chain planning systems. Instead, you should extract the data from it, put it into an analytics and machine learning platform, that can then build a more accurate and more sophisticated demand planning solution. As an external technology provider, that’s the value you’re delivering.</p>

<p>Retail isn’t the only example. There’s lots of companies in financial services, for example, that want to do anti-money laundering better. Solutions here are largely rules based, but as these rules can lead to lots of false positives, this can become expensive because of regulatory requirements on reporting those false positives.</p>

<p>So, now, many of the financial institutions are also now using solutions around anti-money laundering, that are more A.I. based. So rather than have a static rule set, they have a more dynamically evolving neural network-based solution, to detect fraud. They don’t have to replace their core banking systems or they KYC systems. They just use this as a more sophisticated way of detecting fraud.</p>

<p>So, the aspirations of many Data Analytics and Cloud Technology providers is to provide solutions, of course, and move up the value chain, but do this in a way that doesn’t involve building, from scratch, from the ground up, process centric applications, or indeed, entirely re-implementing those business processes. They instead want to build <strong><em>business optimization</em></strong> solutions that allow you to take data out of the application, add more sophistication to it, and then improve an organization’s financial performance that way.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results?</h2>

<p>Many data analytics and cloud technology providers have seen some really amazing results with their customers.</p>

<p>For example, some customers have said “<em>Hey, I’ve been told it would take me 10 years to reoptimize my supply chain infrastructure, but what you guys delivered for me in four months has improved my inventory turns and my supply chain efficiency by ten times.</em>”</p>

<p>They have therefore been able to change how organisations function, in a very fundamental way! Improvements may be about lowering cost, or improving the customer experience, or even detecting things in new ways, like fraud, that were previously not possible.</p>

<h2 id="doing-the-strategic-problems-well">Doing the Strategic Problems well</h2>

<p>It’s not about solving an ocean of problems. For technology providers, it’s really about being able to pick a few very important strategic problems, and then doing a much better job at solving them!</p>

<p>In Hospitals, for example, hundreds of years ago, Louis Pasteur identified and built a solution with the microscope, to let doctors see objects like bacteria and viruses that were not visible to the human eye. That discovery, that solution, changed the foundation of how medical science advanced today!</p>

<p>Today, when hospitals are trying to use data, they’ve had a really hard time correlating information about patients from multiple silos within the hospital. They may have electronic health record systems, clinical care systems, patients registered for a clinical trial, genetic sequencing to see if they have any genetic predisposition to a particular disease, etc., etc.</p>

<p>By pulling all that information together to allow the doctors and the clinicians to see everything in one place, such a solution might allow a medical practitioner to say “<em>Hey, this patient has Type 1 Diabetes risk and they have been registered in this clinical trial, but it doesn’t look like the medicine is working for them</em>”. This is really a new way of helping doctors dramatically improve the standard of care!</p>

<p>The expertise of many technology providers lies in having algorithms that can pull data from different sources and then standardising this data, so that it becomes searchable. So being able to pull data from a variety different systems, that exist in hospitals and put it in front of the clinician, so they can improve the standard of care – that is like providing the quality of what a microscope, just what Louis Pasteur did, on top of data to help clinicians. It’s a key strategic problem, done very, very well!</p>

<h2 id="long-term-vs-short-term">Long Term vs Short Term</h2>

<p>For technology providers, solving big strategic problems is like running a marathon. You have to be patient, because just like a marathon runner typically runs two or three races a year, it doesn’t mean, tomorrow morning, you don’t wake up and train hard for it. So, it does require the ability to blend and balance the need to be patient in the long-term, with a sense of urgency every day.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, it’s really about knowing that you have done something every day, that gives you a feeling of reward every evening, that you were actually able to do something that day that mattered. Complete analytics or technology transformations can take many, many years to take effect, so you have to be patient.</p>

<p>But just as importantly, these kinds of companies should really just be blessed by the fact that you have an amazing collection of people who can bring their very best to work every day!</p>
