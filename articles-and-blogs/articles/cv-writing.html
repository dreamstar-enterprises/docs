<p>Some personal lessons I have learnt (and am learning) in what you can do, and what you can look out for when updating your CV - we all do it sometime in our career!</p>

<p>I used to carry with me only a 1-page version of my CV (on most occasions, it’s enough) and then include further details (of my experiences, achievements, the types of roles I was next looking for, etc.) on the online platform, Linked-In.</p>

<p>What I have learnt so far? The recruitment industry is a fairly opaque and complex one, - a large industry in itself, and often with several routes to getting that next super role!</p>

<p>Applying to advertised positions on online job boards, most to your taste, which you believe you can do, is one option. Success rates with this approach, however, are usually low – I have experienced this first hand. Positions either tend to be very competitive in terms of application ratios, or you’re applying to organizations that are just ‘CV collectors’, with positions that are either out of date, or just don’t exist. You just don’t know!</p>

<p>Your next best bet is usually with headhunters. They try to find opportunities for you in their areas of specialism and regional focus that most closely match with your needs - (it’s their job and they’re incentivised to do so!). With headhunters, just as with any personal interaction, it is important to identify those you’ve found to be most helpful, and to cultivate a relationship with them to get the advice you need. Don’t be afraid of talking to several of them at first, as each will set aside different amounts of time to help you, and differing levels of quality advice, depending on where you are in your job search.</p>

<p>The third approach is to do your own independent research and contact directly the companies you’re most interested in working for. Write to someone internal - as they will be in the advantageous position of knowing which real positions actually exist or what the upcoming opportunities might be. Try and write an eloquently drafted, ‘direct approach’ letter, explaining your motivations for applying, why you think you are a good fit, and what your relevant strengths are, with compelling and recent examples that demonstrate this.</p>

<h2 id="a-1-page-cv">A 1 page CV?</h2>

<p>I eventually became convinced, after speaking to several people in the industry, that a 1-page CV doesn’t always cut it, even if you have a Linked-In profile. Recruiters are likely to only have the time to read one document on you (and that is most likely to be your CV).</p>

<p>Recruitment processes can also differ from company to company, and for many of us. Your CV may be read by your immediate future boss (for the position you are applying for), so including details of your technical knowledge and skills would be important. It could equally be read by a Human Resources specialist, so it would be important to include details of any soft, cognitive, or practical skills you have developed.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-goes-on-your-cv">So what goes on your CV?</h2>

<p>Well, the bigness or smallness of things achieved is not so relevant (it usually shouldn’t be), the structure, however is! There is no clear formula for success, but here is what is working for me!</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Career profile</strong> - what you’re now looking for – no more than three lines.</li>
  <li><strong>Key achievements</strong> - what you’ve been most proud of in your career to date (Remember that searching for your dream job can be a tough, and emotional process, so it does no harm writing down what you think your proudest career achievements have been - it will only help to boost your confidence).</li>
  <li><strong>Education</strong> - write down where you’ve studied - it shows the networks you’ve developed, friends you’ve made, the kind of person you’ve become, etc., which becomes more, and more important as you progress.</li>
  <li><strong>Work experience</strong> - again, where you’ve worked and what you’ve achieved, will show the relevancy of your skills and experiences, and shows what professional networks you might have developed. All useful information to any future employer. Try to quantify what you can to show that you made a positive contribution to whatever it was that you worked on (i.e. where you might have saved money, changed something for the better, discovered something new, reduced complexity in a situation that demanded it, improved the life of someone else, or had a major impact on humanity, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Additional / Transferable skills and Interests</strong> - write these down as it shows what you do or like doing in your free time, when no one else is looking over your shoulder! It tells people something more about you as an individual!</li>
  <li><strong>Personal skills development</strong> - This was a relatively new one for me, but I think probably still helpful. Include it as a short section to show what you have learnt from any skills development courses you have been on. I’ve categorised these into three that made sense to me: (i) Practical skills (including use of recent softwares learnt, etc.), (ii) Soft / Interpersonal skills (e.g. leadership, motivational, oral communication, and where you developed them), and (iii) Cognitive skills (critical, creative thinking, etc., and where you developed them)</li>
  <li><strong>Other</strong> - include an “Other” section, and put here what further information you believe may be useful and relevant (to the CV reader), including where further details can be found (such as on Linked In)</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it, you should be done!</p>

<p>The last piece of advice I’d give, is to try and emphasize your recent experiences. Even if you have achieved and led quite a varied career, (which is no bad thing!), recent experiences will usually matter most to what you want to work on, or can do next. Therefore try and emphasize these, summarizing only the relevant areas of your earliest experiences. It can be tempting to include everything - so try to resist! If you run out of space, put the detailed specifics, or other examples somewhere else, like on Linked-In. Also, if you’ve worked independently, say so, and say what you’ve achieved. If you’ve worked in a group or team, then also say so, and what you’ve achieved. Lastly, keep cultivating those networks, and good luck!</p>
