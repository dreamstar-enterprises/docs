<p>I first heard about Clayton Christensen when I read his book, <strong><em>The Innovator’s Dilemma</em></strong> when I was a student at University. Here is an interesting talk from him on what he calls <strong><em>The Capitalist’s Dilemma</em></strong> - his belief that finance has in some ways been responsible for constraining the growth of <em>Empowering Innovations</em>, - the kinds of innovations that, he asserts, are needed for driving job creation and economic growth.</p>

<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>

<p>Here is a transcript of the talk - given at the Royal Society of Arts, (also publicly available):</p>

<p>“<em>The McKinsey Global Institute did a study, where they identified that there had been nine recessions since World War II. The economy hit bottom, and then rebounded to hit the prior peak, economically. There is always a lag between when the economy hits that prior peak, and also when employment hits that prior peak. For the six out of the first nine recessions, it took about six months, on average, to get to the prior employment peak. For the recession in the early nineties, it took the economy 15 months to get to the employment peak, and then in 2001/2002 it took 39 months to get to the prior peak. When they did the study, they didn’t know the answer, and in the current recovery, where we see the same thing, we still don’t know the answer. In America, it’s been 70 months, and we’re still no longer near to the prior peak of employment. There clearly is something that has gone wrong.</em></p>

<p><em>We have now, a jobless recovery! That wasn’t the case twenty, thirty years ago. So, this is my sense for what is going on. There are three types of innovations in the world. The reason why, in my puzzling of this question, I am focusing on innovation, is because innovation is (and should be) the target of investment, and investment is the fuel that keeps the economy going, in one way, or another.</em></p>

<h2 id="empowering-innovation">Empowering Innovation</h2>

<p><em>The first type of investment, we call the empowering innovation. These are innovations that transform products that previously were complicated and expensive, to products that are simple and affordable.</em></p>

<p><em>If one were to analogize three concentric circles, the center most circle would be customers in a market that have the most money. As you come to the larger circles, they represent larger populations of people who have less money, and less skill.</em></p>

<p><em>A good example of this kind of empowering innovation would be the mainframe computer. Mainframes used to cost $2m, not very many people could have a computer. Then the personal computer reduced the cost from $2m to $2k, and so, most of us could own and use a computer. Now, the smartphone, for $200, enables billions of people around the world to have a computer.</em></p>

<p><em>In a similar way, when the automobile was developed, originally they were the “toy of the rich”, but Henry Ford with the Model T, made a car so affordable and accessible that millions and millions of people could have one.</em></p>

<p><em>From our study, I will assert, that nearly all of the jobs in an economy are created by empowering innovations! The reason is very simple: if you make it (a product or service) affordable and accessible, more people buy them, more people use them, you have to hire people to make them, distribute them, sell them, and service them, and so on.</em></p>

<p><em>Empowering innovations use capital, because anytime you start a new business, you need capital on the balance sheet. This is the first type of innovation for the purpose of the talk tonight.</em></p>

<h2 id="sustaining-innovation">Sustaining Innovation</h2>

<p><em>The second type of innovation, we call sustaining innovations. Sustaining innovations make good products better. In fact, when you just look at the world, most of the innovations that we see are sustaining innovations that make good products better.</em></p>

<p><em>They have a different effect on the economy, however, in that sustaining innovations create few if any jobs. They’re kind of a neutral as it relates to capital. The reason why sustaining innovations don’t create a lot of jobs is because when you sell a better product, the customer doesn’t buy the old product.</em></p>

<p><em>Toyota developed a marvelous hybrid car called the Prius, but whenever they successfully sell a Prius, they don’t sell a Camry. By their very nature sustaining innovations are replacitive in character, and that’s why they don’t create a lot of jobs.</em></p>

<h2 id="efficiency-innovations">Efficiency Innovations</h2>

<p><em>Then the third type of innovation, we call efficiency innovations. Efficiency innovations allow you to make the same products at lower prices to sell to the same customers. In America, for example, there is an online Insurance company called Geiko. Same products, 15% lower priced. Walmart is an efficiency innovation. They can sell the same products to the same customers at 15% lower prices.</em></p>

<p><em>Efficiency innovations are also very critical to the economy. If we didn’t have them, then whole economies would be blown out of the water. However, they reduce jobs by their very nature. Over and over again you see this. If Walmart is going into a town, as they build their store they hire a lot of people, but in aggregate, generally, there are about 15% fewer jobs in that area in retailing, when they have done their work.</em></p>

<p><em>Interestingly though, efficiency innovations free capital. What I mean by that, by illustration, is that before Toyota came to America, it took American car companies about 60 days to assemble a car, and as the car crawled through this plant there had to be a lot of work in process inventory on the balance sheet to support that process. Toyota figured out how to assemble a car in 2.5 days, and because it zipped through the process, they didn’t need to have nearly as much work in process inventory on the balance sheet, and it essentially took capital that had been imprisoned on the balance sheet, and it freed it up to do remarkable things.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-discovery">The Discovery</h2>

<p><em>So it is kind of a neat, almost perpetual motion machine. As long as we create more jobs through empowering innovations, then efficiency innovations reduce, and as long as capital that is created by efficiency innovations is enough to fund empowering innovations it just keeps going and going, and in fact, in America, the first six recessions, this pattern seems to work well. Almost like clockwork, resetting itself every time.</em></p>

<p><em>But then something has gone wrong. My sense of what’s gone wrong is that finance has cut the perpetual circle, and created a system where there is a beginning and an end, essentially. Really, what finance is causing us to do is take efficiency innovations and reinvest in efficiency innovations (not empowering innovations), over time.</em></p>

<p><em>Theory is a very important element in everything that we do, and finance has a really strong theory associated with it.</em> <strong><em>Management slowly becomes the assembling, optimising and shipping of numbers!</em></strong> <em>Part of it is an observation that the shareholders are important. Part of it comes from calculus. You have to have something to minimize or maximize, or calculus isn’t very worthwhile.</em></p>

<p><em>Milton Friendman gave us this assertion that the role of management is to maximize returns on capital to the shareholders, and he solved a problem. Mathematics needs something to optimize, and so it was assumed that that is what finance was about.</em></p>

<p><em>Then, in addition to having a really powerful theory set, there are tools that are available for finance (like Lotus, and Excel). I want to assert that the development of the spreadsheet by Dan Brickman, at the Harvard Business School, had a bigger impact on management than almost anything in the last 100 years.</em></p>

<p><em>I remember when I was an MBA student, they taught me how to calculate Internal Rate of Return. I had a four function calculator in the mid 70’s, and I had a pencil, and a sheet of paper and we had to work out the pro-formas, and then I remember, I clicked equate, and I came up with an Internal Rate of Return that clearly was not right. It was just so difficult! We had a concept Internal Rate of Return, but we really couldn’t use it per se. And thank goodness for these spreadsheets, because you could build a model of a company, and then test, well if I change this input, or this assumption, what will the impact be on Internal Rate of Return, or Return on Net Assets, or whatever. This had a huge impact.</em></p>

<p><em>Also, finance really has become a profession, not just a job, and it is led by powerful people, intellectually. Of its own, finance is a machine! The impact that this has had is that now a 26 year old analyst who has a spreadsheet can figure out what inputs need to be at what levels to get the outputs that they are going to use to measure whether management is being successful or not. So, you have this odd situation, where somebody who has never run a company sits across the desk from a manager and tells them how to run the company.</em></p>

<p><em>It is interesting that the managers obey the commandments(1) that finance gives to them. Increasingly, finance takes charge of how the economy works.</em></p>

<p>(1) Commandments:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Return on Net Assets; 2. Return on Capital Employed; 3. Internal Rate of Return; 4. Earnings per Share; 5. Gross Margin Percentage; 6. Economic Value Added; 7. Marginal Cost / Marginal Revenue; 8. Debt / Equity; 9. Growth Rate; 10. Revenue per employee.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="abundant-and-scare-resources">Abundant and Scare Resources</h2>

<p><em>Now there is a really smart economist, named George Gilder, and he made an assertion that if you get all of the inputs that are required to make an output, a product or service that you’re going to sell, some of these inputs are going to be very abundant and cheap, like sand, and things that are abundant and cheap, you don’t have to worry about them. You don’t have to account for them in anyway.</em></p>

<p><em>However, he points out that there are other types of innovations that are scarce and costly, and must be deployed carefully. Things that are scarce and costly, you’ve got to really watch them, and husband their use, and deploy them only in places in the market where they will yield the highest return.</em></p>

<p><em>Well, as this juggernaut of finance emerged (because of their power), they observed that capital in 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s was scarce and very costly. Therefore that is what we ought to measure: are we deploying capital in applications that yield the highest return?</em></p>

<p><em>An interesting thing that finance has done to managers is that they have given them options. Before all of this happened, the way a manager measured profitability was with crude measures like tonnes of cash. Now finance has given managers ratios! This sophistication gives them options. So for example, Internal Rate of Return is a common measure. It is a ratio – the numerator is profit, the denominator is speed. So I can get Internal Rate of Return up in one of two ways: make more profit through innovation, or only invest in projects that pay off very short term. Either one gets internal rate of return up. So, finance brought to management this logic, and a language of ratios.</em></p>

<p><em>So, what impact has that then had on this overall process? Well, you create more capital through efficiency innovations. Then, the analysts have to think, ‘Gosh’! We’ve got capital, where should we deploy it. By using these ratios, they realize, gosh, the problem with empowering innovations is that those things pay off in five to ten years. We’d actually have to take capital and stick it on the balance sheet. If we took that same capital, because of the commandments, and recycle them back into efficiency innovations, the great thing about efficiency innovations is that they pay off in a year or two, and instead of using capital, they create more capital. What a deal! So they re-invest in efficiency innovations, more money comes out, then they say ‘geez’ I wonder what we should do with this capital? There is still a little bit of capital that goes up to empowering innovations, but my sense is that over the last 20 years, the number of empowering innovations that our economy is generating is about a third the level that it was in the 50s, 60s and 70s.</em></p>

<p><em>What we see here is that private equity shops, and hedge funds, just complain that there is so much money chasing so few deals, and entrepreneurs complaining that they can’t get funding. What is happening in our economy is that because of this recycling (capital back into efficiency innovations), we are awash with capital, and the cost of capital is now nearly zero, and yet we can’t create new jobs because the financing mechanism hijacks capital and recycles it into itself.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p><em>Where is this heading is an interesting question! Do you remember that in the 1960s, 70s, and early 80s, Japan’s economy was just a juggernaut. It was growing at unprecedented rates in the world! They transformed themselves from poverty into prosperity in about 25 years. What is it that was the engine of Japan’s miracle? It was that they, in my language, disrupted America through empowering innovations. So, for example, Toyota made a car that was so affordable that the low end of humanity, people we call teenagers today, could own a car. Do you remember what Sony did? They made rusty little, pocket radios that cost two dollars, that made millions of people have music wherever they went. And Canon made a printer so affordable and accessible that we could have one in every office, and every home, and because of these empowering innovations, billions of people around the world had access to these products made by companies in Japan. For thirty years their unemployment rate was less than 2%. If you were alive, you had a job!</em></p>

<p><em>Starting, however, in the late 1980s, the successful Japanese companies started to hire graduates of business schools in the West who brought with them this logic of how to measure investments and how to guide things - in ways that maximize return on net assets, and internal rate of return. My sense, and I think I’m right, is that since 1990 Japan’s economy has generated only 1 empowering innovation, and that is the Nintendo Wii! It’s the only one, and their economy has been dead or flat for 23 years. They are awash with capital, the cost of capital is zero, and they just can’t get out of it.</em></p>

<p><em>I think that capital isn’t the problem! The problem is the way we calculate success makes it impossible for innovators to invest in the kinds of things that create jobs, and so we have recoveries without jobs - the Capitalist’s dilemma!</em> ”</p>
