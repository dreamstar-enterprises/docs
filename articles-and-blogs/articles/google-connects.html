<p>Listening to the talk by Sundar Pichai at the Mobile Me conference in Barcelona, I couldn’t help but feel inspired. Here was a man of very extraordinary abilities, who, until his very recent promotion to CEO, was somewhat of an unknown entity in the technology sector, but who was now explaining to a conference of attendees of Mobile OEMs, what he saw as his vision for the future of Google.</p>

<p>Over the talk, I was particularly impressed by what Google have been doing beyond hardware and software, especially in the area of connectivity, and the various projects they have been investing in to bring better connectivity to those in the world who don’t yet have it.</p>

<p>Sundar reminded us that many of us (in the Western World) still complain about broadband WiFi speeds, and of how very fortunate people are in the West, pointing out that there are almost 4 billion people in the world who are still either completely offline or who have very poor connectivity.</p>

<p>In fact during their travels, Sundar spoke of how Google employees constantly hear of anecdotes of people trying to get better connectivity - such as that of a boy in Brazil who they found climbing up a tree, to try to catch a little signal that he needed for his Smart Phone.</p>

<p>Google are trying to address this inequality, and currently, their access efforts in bringing connectivity to the world span across 3 main areas: (with the approach taken differing depending on whether they are targeting rural areas or urban areas)</p>

<p>Here they are…</p>

<h2 id="project-link">Project Link</h2>

<p>This was a project that Google started in Campala Uganda, about 1 year ago. They started by building a fibre network, and asked local service operators to provide services on top of this “<em>backbone</em>”. The project has since gotten a lot of traction and has been very exciting for Google, who plan to roll it out to other countries in Africa.</p>

<h2 id="project-loon">Project Loon</h2>

<p>The second area is a bit more science fiction than anything else, but has been trialed by Google successfully to show what is possible when you combine far reaching foresight, creativity, and a willingness to try. <em>Project Loon</em>!</p>

<p>The project started about four years ago as an experimental idea. The company’s idea was to float balloons in the sky, and make them act as floating cell towers. This is obviously interesting for Google and Mr Pichai because it combines real world, physical atmospheric science with what Google do best, computer science!</p>

<p>Though, even Sundar admitted it would be a huge undertaking - having to manage a large fleet of balloons at scale in the Stratosphere, at heights of 50 to 60 thousand feet. The project was started in New Zealand about two years ago - but at that time they could barely keep a balloon up for 5 days and were serving 3G speeds to Antennas on the ground.</p>

<p>Today, most balloons are able to stay up for as long as 6 months, or 200 days, and instead of serving 3G speeds, they have progressed to serving LTE speeds directly to mobile handsets on the ground, which has been an exciting development. Pichai says “<em>The model they say is really beginning to work for them, and they have begun large scale testing with Vodafone, Telefonica and Telstrand.</em>”</p>

<h2 id="project-titan">Project Titan</h2>

<p>The final project Google are working on is <em>Project Titan</em>.</p>

<p>Titan is at a stage where Loon was about two years ago. Sundar says the concept is the same, to have floating cell towers, but instead of balloons, to use very light weight, solar powered airplanes that fly in the sky - imagined as a constellation of balloons and planes that work together to create a Mesh of floating cell towers.</p>

<p>The project makes a lot of sense, particular in disaster relief zones, where plans can be used to supplement a lot of areas that need extra capacity and temporarily high connectivity, and just as with Loon, Project Titan is about to take its first major steps, flying its planes over the coming few months.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future!</h2>

<p>So with <em>Project Link</em>, <em>Project Loon</em>, and <em>Project Titan</em>, these are all access efforts which Google are working hard on to create a connectivity backbone, with the help of carrier partners, who can them provide their services on top of this - to both urban and rural areas across the world.</p>

<p>Sundar remains dogmatic about the potential success of the projects. When questioned, whether there would be a role for aerial cellular towers in developed countries, like US and Europe - the man humbly replied “<em>I think so. I talked about capacity, and even in places such as the US and Europe, we’ve all struggled with peak demand situations. So I think being able to move things up when you need to, and provide connectivity, is a huge opportunity</em>.”</p>

<p>When further asked about the advertising ecosystems in these parts of the world being non-existent, and the business model that would justify the investment his response was:</p>

<p>“<em>For us history has shown that if you take a long term view, and actually do something that delivers value to users, and it matters, and do it at a scale at which you get users onto the platform, the business model tends to work out. It has worked out for us in search, Android, and other companies, including Facebook, have shown this to be true. So we are very comfortable taking a long term view, and that people would be willing to pay for connectivity, so I think we can make the model work out just fine.</em>”</p>

<p>Its an exciting endeavor, because it is the kind of approach the has characterized Google’s approach to many things, once again focusing on things that work at scale for billions of users and make a big difference to people’s day to day lives, just as it had done with Google Search, Android, You Tube and Chrome!</p>

<p>So, well done Sundar, and well done Google!</p>
