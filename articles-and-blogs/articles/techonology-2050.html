<p>How much do we really know about the technology of 2050? Well, to set about predicting the future it helps to have a toolkit! The clues are there, and can be found in the <em>patterns</em> of the past, the “<em>edge cases</em>” of the present, and the “<em>imagined futures</em>” of science fiction. After this it’s then a case of applying the tools!</p>

<p>We are all currently living in a very fertile period of discovery, which in many ways echoes the scientific revolution of the 17th century. There’s only one difference: because today we have complete and accurate equations to the foundations of everything from nuclear physics, chemistry, and all plausible forms of engineering, it means, unlike the 17th century, <strong><em>calculation can increasingly replace experimentation</em></strong> in developing technology, allowing for much faster progress!</p>

<p>Many astute technologists will know that successive technologies arrive in waves, and that in each wave, a crowd of companies emerge, but only a few make it to shore. We are all now probably witnessing the seventh such wave, still in its early stages of formation. This wave carries artificial intelligence companies. This is not something completely new: early stage venture capitalists have been investing in A.I. since 2010, but now with billions of dollars pouring in, a rapid, virtuous, and completive cycle is quickly picking up, and creating an invisible momentum, whose force is likely to be felt in decades ahead!</p>

<p>With so much disruption promised on the horizon, it’s not hard to feel excited about the extraordinary advances that will soon be within our reach. Services will be delivered faster, cheaper, and better. Access to services will also be widened, reducing inequality. Food will become more abundant through gene editing. People will become healthier though the use of A.I., regenerative medicine, and big data. Energy will be cleaner with renewable sources, transport safer with autonomous vehicles, and people, generally, will have access to more opportunities.</p>

<p>We need to be careful though, as lessons from history tell us that there can be many unintended consequences, and dangerous disruption from misusing technology! We are quick to forget that problems blamed on technology are often actually the result of human nature! As one Chicago policemen all the way back in 1888 so well put it:</p>

<p>“<em>It is a well-known fact that no other section of the population avails themselves more speedily and readily of the latest triumphs in science and technology than the criminal class!</em>”</p>

<p>Does this mean you should become a criminal? Probably not! (But it does mean criminals are clever and opportunistic!) And whilst analogies are never perfect, and history never repeats itself exactly, analogies don’t have to be perfect to be informative! Which is why looking at history helps!</p>

<p>One can find many repeating patterns from the history of technology. New inventions often provoke concerns that they will destroy privacy - the first Kodak camera, for example, caused panic over surreptitious public photography in the 1880s, much as Google Glass did in 2013. Such inventions were accused of corrupting the morals of the young, a very similar charge that was levelled against novels in the 1790s, motion pictures in the 1910s, comic books in the 1950s, and video games in the 1990s!</p>

<p>So whilst there is almost always going to be concern over any new technology that allows man to play the hand of god, these are all just modern-day versions of the age-old question of whether mankind could be trusted with the gift of fire! It’s not an easy one to answer!</p>

<p>But irrespective of whether such past concerns are merited or not, it is the reactions to these past technologies that we should pay close attention to, as they give us the best clues about how new innovations or discoveries are likely to be received!</p>

<h2 id="whats-on-the-horizon">What’s on the horizon?</h2>

<p>Well, as William Gibson, the famous science fiction writer, once memorably put it,</p>

<p>“<em>the future is already here – it’s just not very evenly distributed!</em>”</p>

<p>This is very true! Technologies have a surprisingly long gestation period! They might seem to appear overnight, but they actually don’t! Consequently, if you look in the right places, you should see tomorrow’s technology today.</p>

<p>Identifying tomorrow’s technology today can often be done by looking at so called “<em>edge cases</em>” - examples of technologies or behaviours, adopted by a particular group, or in particular countries, before they go on to become mainstream.</p>

<p>One such example of an edge case is that of Japan and smartphones at the turn of this century. In 2001, mobile handsets with cameras and colour screens were commonplace in Japan. These phones could display maps with walking directions, download e-books, games, and other apps. Journalists would often flock to Japan as it was the only place in the world they could see such smartphones in action.</p>

<p>The reason behind Japan’s success? Japan arrived in the future early because of the isolated, proprietary nature of its telecoms industry. Its domestic market was large enough to allow technology companies to experiment with ideas without worrying about compatibility with other countries’ systems.</p>

<p>The same thing in Kenya, which had long led the world in the adoption of Mobile money. Mobile money really took off in Kenya because the lack of banking infrastructure offered a clean slate. Political factors also played a role such as such as the post-election violence of 2007-08, when it was seen as a safe alternative to banks.</p>

<p>Sometimes, edge cases have nothing to do with a particular place, but people who share a particular interest, who then pioneer the use of a particular technology. A clear example here is the technology community that have led the way in adopting all things from email, fitness tracking apps, to Uber!</p>

<p>Now whilst trend spotting is hard, and all edge cases do not take off, what is undeniable is that all technologies that do eventually catch on, go through an underground period where their use is restricted to a subpopulation (hopefully, not the criminals!)</p>

<h2 id="where-are-we-headed">Where are we headed?</h2>

<p>Here are four distinctly promising areas that seem to be close on the horizon:</p>

<h3 id="human-gene-modification">Human Gene Modification</h3>

<p>You could say that if physics has reached a creative level of maturity, then biology, with rapidly developing areas such as gene-editing, and regenerative medicine, now bubbles with a youthful excitement! Whole industries are likely to be transformed by bio-engineering, as we are able to build just about anything we see in nature, including allowing genes that cause hereditary diseases to be completely removed from humans!</p>

<p>Behind biotechnology’s formidable potential lies the “<em>hyper exponential</em>” increase in the productivity of DNA sequencing. Its soaring efficiency - commonly represented by “<em>the Carlson Curve</em>” - has often been compared to the relentless improvement in Microchips, known as Moore’s law. And although Moore’s law is gradually running out of steam, it looks like innovations in health care will continue to be helped though a combination of 3D chips, quantum computers, and having more of our processing work being done in the “<em>cloud</em>”.</p>

<h3 id="virtual--augmented-reality">Virtual &amp; Augmented Reality</h3>

<p>Having failed miserably in the 1990s because the technology was not up to the job, Virtual Reality (VR) made a big comeback in 2016, with several companies launching high-end headsets. And although today’s headsets may seem clunky, like the mobile phones of yesteryear, within a couple of years, they are likely to be much smaller devices that people will be able to routinely carry around.</p>

<p>Probably more exciting than VR is Augmented Reality (AR), an area likely to represent the next big step in computer interfaces, beyond the touchscreen. And although a world in which imagery is overlaid onto reality is likely to cause a moral panic over their effects on children, just as films and video games did before them, proponents of the technology are now much more likely to commission research to address any such speculation, emphasising their educational and therapeutic uses, as well as their potential in entertainment, communication, and collaboration.</p>

<h3 id="autonomous-vehicles">Autonomous Vehicles</h3>

<p>Cars capable of driving themselves are now taking to the roads, with self-driving trucks on the horizon too!</p>

<p>With autonomous vehicles, there are many historical parallels with the advent of the motorcar more than a century ago. Then, there were concerns over safety, regulatory uncertainty, liability in case of accident, and worries that the new technology would destroy jobs. But whilst cars did displace the existing infrastructure that had been built around horses and carriages and their related professions, the new car industry ended up creating many new jobs for mechanics, drivers and workers in roadside stations, restaurants and motels, and also stimulated commerce more generally by making travel easier. A switch to autonomous vehicles is likely to have a similar dislocating effect, but also offer benefits in the long term!</p>

<p>Models even suggest that self-driving taxis could reduce the number of vehicles needed in a city by 90%, and with it the space wasted on parking (by as much as 20% of the area in some cities) – which could be used for housing and parks instead! So just as cars have reconfigured cities in the 20th century, historic and current trends suggest autonomous ones could do the same in the 21st!</p>

<h3 id="private-spaceflight">Private Spaceflight!</h3>

<p>Lastly, we turn to the final frontier: Spaceflight!</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that most progress in space technology has been made not by the government, but by private companies, such as SpaceX. SpaceX had pioneered the technology of reusable rockets, which was significant business, as the first stage of a rocket accounts for 70% of its cost, and is normally discarded in the sea after its launch.</p>

<p>With Space Travel, whilst there are many analogies in the past probably worth exploring, such as during the era of Arctic and Antarctic explorations, and private expeditions being generally more successful and having higher survival rates than government funded ones, perhaps the most striking is with the development of aviation.</p>

<p>At the start of the 20th century, heavier than air flight was considered impossible. Once it was shown to be feasible, it was considered dangerous. Starting in the 1930s it began to evolve into an industry catering to the rich. By the end of the century air travel became widely affordable! Given its current rate of progress, it’s not unreasonable to assume that the space industry might follow a similar trajectory, from crazy to commonplace!</p>

<h2 id="to-the-future">To the future!</h2>

<p>Given the incessant pace at which A.I. technologies are developing (remember, we are only at the beginning of the 7th wave!), and the fact that physical and biological sciences, today, are becoming more and more like information sciences than anything else – and couple this with the rapid development of new information processing techniques, such as “<em>big data</em>” and “<em>machine learning</em>” systems, humanity will very soon be discovering the extent of its own ignorance across many, many fields - biology and physics in particular – all resulting in a very fertile (and exciting!) period of discovery and invention, which I greatly look forward to!</p>
