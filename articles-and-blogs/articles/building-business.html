<h2 id="incumbents-that-lose-their-edge">Incumbents that lose their edge</h2>

<p>About 12 years ago, I walked into a small bookstore, in a small English town, and picked up a book “The Innovator’s Dilemma” – by Clayton Christiansen. (now since named by The Economist as <strong>one</strong> of the <strong>six</strong> most important books about business ever written!)</p>

<p>I wanted to better understand what disruptive technologies where, and why it is, that even when companies seem to do everything “right”, they still lose their competitive edge - a question, I am still, in some ways, looking for a more complete answer to…</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of what I learnt!</p>

<h2 id="incumbents-and-the-s-curve">Incumbents and the ‘S’ curve!</h2>

<p>Big companies (incumbents) have big customers, and with it expectations of sustained high annual sales. New entrants, on the other hand, target niches that an incumbent cannot and do not need the high annual sales that an incumbent does.</p>

<p>Big companies are slow on the innovation “S-Curve”, while a new entrant can go deep on the innovation “S-Curve” and provide significant value that way. And, sometimes, by the time the new product becomes interesting, it can be too late for the incumbent to react.</p>

<p>E.g. - thinking of opening a new business account in the UK? See what disruptor Starling are doing to the UK Business Banking landscape! <a href="https://www.starlingbank.com/business-account/compare-business-bank-accounts/#/compare" target="_blank">Starling</a></p>

<p>Moreover, the attributes that make disruptive technologies unattractive in established markets are often also the ones that have the greatest value in emerging markets.</p>

<h2 id="incumbents-facing-disruption">Incumbents facing disruption!</h2>

<p>So what should an incumbent do, in the face of such disruption?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re legacy businesses that wants to transform itself, you need a change in both mindset, and then, with that, skill set. Radical innovation needs a change in processes, skill sets, technology, culture, and mindset. Can you harbour this somewhere in your organisation?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complacency of leadership can often be a factor that results from companies failing to disrupt themselves. When you have been a leader in your category, for several years, it’s easy to believe you are too big to fail. But then look what happened to Blockbuster!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disruption isn’t something that happens from one day to the next. It is a gradual process that happens over a number of years, possibly decades, where the disruptors slowly gain market share while the incumbents fail to see or respond to the threats.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disruptors can be focused on a small niche or on a set of customers in which the incumbents have no interest. So, look for where there is no interest! Incumbents often fail because they fall into the trap of underestimating the complexity of their own legacy technologies or processes, or overestimate their own ability to innovate quickly because they underestimate the speed at which customer behavior is changing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Radical innovation requires radical changes in processes, skill sets, technology, culture, and mind-sets. This can be daunting, and just takes lots of time times. And nothing will happen if not backed by significant investment, commitment, or regulatory backing (when it comes to addressing negative externalities)!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unless the leadership team really believes it is a matter of survival and recognizes the reality of the threat to its dominant position, it won’t be willing to put the organization through the upheaval and stress of change. (Fair enough!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking a company through radical change is obviously a difficult task and requires a specific skill set that may not be obvious to those who have known only continuous growth and success. Business Leaders who either don’t have that skill set or mind set, or aren’t able to recognize the need for it will miss opportunities for his or her company. Also, CEOs in times of growth and innovation are different from CEOs focused on profits and stability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often, legacy elements that are most underestimated (e.g. mind-sets, legacy IT, or legacy processes) can reinforce one another It all starts with mind-set and culture. People can fix technology and processes; they can’t fix themselves! And, unless a company is led by people who embrace innovation and change, it will remain stuck in a legacy state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To effect change in an organization, the first requirement is for individuals and teams to trust each other as well as their leaders. If this trust doesn’t already exist, it will take time, commitment, and a potential leadership change to establish it!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Individuals and teams must believe they are working toward a purpose that is bigger than themselves or the company. This will motivate them in hard times to continue reaching for that North (or South!) Star and help attract the best talent! When faced with the choice to work for a company that is trying to help solve an impactful challenge versus one focused solely on profits, the answer is clear!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Talent empowerment</em></strong> can’t be dictated — it needs to be enabled through culture, tools, and processes. Individuals and teams need to feel comfortable disagreeing with their peers and leaders. They should be enabled by easy access to data to experiment, measure, and iterate quickly. Failure from experimentation and quick decision making should be part of the norm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The best way to remove roadblocks is to change mind-sets first. The tone must be set from the very top through the CEO, executive team, and the board. There can be no hesitation, and a clear vision and <strong>unified</strong> agenda are vital to deploying the necessary resources to promote cultural charge throughout the organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are many of CVCs (Corporate Venture Funds) out there, unclear on whether they are strategic to their parent company or what exactly their investment criteria is, because the messaging is too complicated, overly legalistic, and not simple! This not only confuses other funds that may be a source of deals. It also confuses the target companies. It also makes it more difficult for the people running the fund to focus on finding the right companies that will add value if the strategy isn’t clear. Clarity is key!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Companies looking to disrupt must plan their start-up strategy well, before setting up a possible CVC. For example, does it want to acquire start-ups, does it want to partner with them, or does it want to learn from them?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incumbents also need to ask themselves whether they have the ability — i.e. culture, processes, and skills — to execute on its start-up strategy. If the answer is no, then resources should be secured to address these challenges. Otherwise, all the time and money spent running the fund will result in very little return on investment.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incumbents also need to identify what the start-ups need, and which needs they can fulfill with minimal friction to the legacy business. One example is distribution, which start-ups often lack access to. They may have technology and a product, but they struggle with acquiring customers. Corporations, on the other hand, have significant distribution channels and customers. The key is to make these easily accessible to start-ups, or with enough backing the start-up will create their own infrastructure (Tesla’s charging stations?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incumbents should have an existing, repeatable process within to deal with start-up partnerships. This process should not require lengthy nondisclosure agreements or integrations. Corporations need to create a user-friendly sandbox type of environment where selective start-ups can access a defined set of customers for testing – i.e. the “right” customers. Once the testing is successful, they can then be given access to a greater number of customers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the incumbent is committed to working with start-ups and scale-ups in the long term, it should invest in transplanting their DNA to help bridge the culture and communications gap. Start-ups and corporations typically don’t understand each other’s processes and methods of communication, so it’s important to have someone who can straddle both worlds to enable the right approach.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a <strong><em>platform</em></strong> model, an incumbent might have a number of <strong><em>independent</em></strong> business units that have their own strategy, revenue model, and leadership team who drive decision making.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These units report back to a group executive team, often a much smaller entity in charge primarily of financing and investment decisions - such as investing in existing operations, acquiring other businesses, issuing dividends, paying down debt, or repurchasing stock—and of hiring the best executives to fill out the leadership roles across the organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Alphabet, for example, leans toward this model, making it easy to integrate new companies through acquisitions. These companies can continue to operate somewhat autonomously, and their success rate is much higher, such as with Amazon and Zappos</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With a <strong><em>centralized</em></strong> model, however, integration becomes more complex, as the acquired company needs to be <strong><em>fully assimilated</em></strong>, its processes often fundamentally changed, and its culture vastly diluted. As a result, the rate of success is much lower and the cost far higher.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If an incumbent comes to the realization that its survival depends on <strong><em>significant innovation</em></strong> rather than <strong><em>incremental change</em></strong>, and it lacks the ability to execute on that innovation with its existing resources, it can choose to follow one of two routes: it can either acquire innovation or hire people to effect the change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The second route takes time and a commitment to changing the culture of the company, and to training not only the senior executives but the middle management as well. It requires hard choices, patience, and perseverance!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The first route, if an incumbent follows the platform model, may be quicker and achievable. However, in a centralized model, if the incumbent wants to acquire and integrate innovative companies, it will need to adjust its culture as in the second route. It will have to update its processes, technology, and skills to ease the integration and make it successful. So, unless there is a true commitment to cultural change, the chances of survival are slim.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, today there is often no such thing as a linear career. Most people experience step changes with periods of plateau. It’s all about keeping a growth mind-set. You can always improve and grow, but you need to be willing to take risks, fail, learn from failures, try again, and persevere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No person can really have a favourite failure, because who really likes to fail? But if you do, try and find the positives. This will help you carry on and not get bogged down. There is always something to learn from and to use to grow into a better person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is a great lesson to be learnt about the importance of nurturing relationships at work too. If you’re so focused on execution that you forget about the soft side of your role, it could at some point come back to haunt you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But having a much stronger focus on <strong><em>culture</em></strong> and <strong><em>communications</em></strong>, will, here, in the incumbent’s case, make for much better execution!</p>
  </li>
