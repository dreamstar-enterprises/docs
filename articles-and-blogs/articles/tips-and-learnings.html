<h2 id="time-management-vs-attention-management">Time Management vs Attention Management?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I think it’s all about “<strong><em>Attention Management</em></strong>”. In my life, whenever I’ve found something I want to do, and do right, I’m really compelled to finish it! Whatever other demands there maybe on my time, those demands will take second place, because when I’m doing something I want to do, and it has my attention, I will be in true “positive flow.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you judge yourself entirely by how well you time manage, you will always end up beating yourself up about how unproductive, or how much time you might have wasted here or there, if things don’t always go your way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But you can’t entirely ignore “<strong><em>Time Management</em></strong>”. Being punctual, and attending meetings when you promise and say to others that you will, is still important and how many things get done in the world. So, in the end, a fine balance is needed between the both time and attention management. Overall, people are mostly driven by the people and projects they care about most, and not so much by the “<em>nominal</em>” time they devote to each - that’s not something they religiosly keep track of. Most people won’t move onto the next thing, until they feel they’ve made meaningful progress on what they’re working on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are all about “<strong><em>Time Management</em></strong>”, then one useful framework to follow is “The seven habits of highly effective people” by Stephen Covey – to try and stratify your life, and to-do lists, by “what’s urgent”, “what’s not urgent”, “what’s important”, and “what’s not important” – and do the things most in tune with your values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re doing things by the “clock” you’re doing things that are externally imposed on you. If, however, you’re doing things by the “compass” – you’re doing the things more internal to you, you’re doing the things you are most passionate about.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re torn between doing lots of things, just have a “bigger yes” burning inside of you, and say “no” to more things.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="take-rest-breaks">Take Rest Breaks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>“Busyness” is a feature of life! Often people will like to complain about it, when it is instead a boast disguised as a complaint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But if you’re busy because of the “clock”, then that most likely means you’re doing things that are externally imposed on you, rather than following your true passions - your “true compass!”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Regardless of how busy you are, doing whatever it is you are doing, you should give your mind and body regular rest breaks! Understand the biology and psychology of how you as a “human-being” / “homo-sapien” works. Become physically, mentally, and more self-body, self-aware.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe take a day off in the week, to treat yourself to a nice long lunch break, and have some gym / exercise time built into your week!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="practice-contentment">Practice Contentment</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is the second law of thermodynamics that says the entropy in any closed system will always increase. Randomness, Brownian motion, the asymmetry between past and future, irreversibility of processes, call it what you will, they are a fact of life! As a consequence, at any moment in time, there will be happy people, and unhappy people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You might think that some people are born charismatic, or born athletic, or born into a wealthy family, and will therefore always be happy. Or, you might think that because you were denied something unfairly, or because things are out of your control, and don’t quite go your way, you should be unhappy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But that’s just wrong thinking. Happiness is a choice! Your emotional state depends on how you react and respond to your circumstances, and rationalise on the outcome that’s happened, whether it was right or wrong (in your own mind). It’s a mental state and mind-set you carry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can be angry, if you choose to be. That’s fine. You can feel justified to express your emotions in that way - if you feel you have suffered a great injustice, for example. Or you can choose not to respond emotionally in that way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practicing contentment is not easy, because society always trains us to be perpetually discontent! The easy flows of information means its always easier to find people who are more successful, and more lucky than you are! For example, you can always find somebody who is wealthier than you are. But realise, and acknowledge, that life always has a way of balancing itself out!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead try to have an ‘abundance’ mentality. Don’t think about what you don’t have. Think about and be grateful for the things you do have! The simple things, such as: access to clean water from your kitchen taps; being able to eat at a restaurant and have food served to you; being able to store your food in a refridgerator so that it doesn’t go off; or the fact that you can probably afford to go on holiday for a month to any corner of the world!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stay-physically-fit">Stay Physically fit!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Keeping in shape and staying physically fit is important, but not always urgent – because the effects not exercising aren’t going to be realised immediately.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But your body, mind, and health is core to everything you do! If you are pursuing your passion, then this takes an incredible amount of energy, dedication, and drive. And, this is difficult to do, if you’re tired or feel unhealthy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If immersing yourself in a physical activity that involves the exchange of talents is the best way you think you can stay physically fit, then do that. Participate in a Fitness class at your nearest gym, or play for a local sports team.</p>

<h2 id="its-about-both-the-journey-and-final-outcome">It’s about BOTH the Journey and Final Outcome</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Sure, it’s disappointing to feel disappointed when the results we want just don’t come. But think about the journey too, because whether you achieve something or not, for most things, half the time this will just come down to luck.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you win a particular thing, for example, the fact that you won it, is just going to be down to too many factors outside your control. Instead, just have the feeling that you pushed yourself, tried your very best, and that there wasn’t anything more, at any point, you could have done, to have achieve whatever it is you wanted to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you fail to acheive the first time, whatever it is you want to, then ask for feedback, and then “bounce back” and have another go! Try something different, try a different approach, keep practicing at what works for you, until you get to that final outcome you desire!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="commit-but-also-adapt">Commit, but also Adapt</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you’ve committed to something at work, then commit to it. Be excellent at it, and reach as far out into your network, to achieve the highest standard of excellence you possibly can!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pull your fair share on any project. Be trusted, and be credible – that’s the first key to establishing a strong business relationship. Be known as somebody other people can rely on!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have to work long hours, because others in your team cop out, do so joyfully, not grudgingly, and then change how you might do things, and who you work with, how you motivate, incentivse, and influence them next time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember, people will remember you, not always for what you do, but more so for how you do things. So really try to make people remember you for that – your bravery, energy, heart, and determination!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let that be your comparative advantage!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
