<p>In life, luck does matter! There may be some things outside your control, but you actually have far more control over your life than you think. It’s very tempting, when things do go wrong: to blame other people, or to blame luck, or to blame that <em>undesirable outcome</em> on something else.</p>

<p>But people have far more control over their futures than they really think - you don’t have to be a slave to external circumstances, or the cards that were dealt to you. Stuart Pearce, for example, who started his life as a plumber and electrician, ended up becoming the captain of the England soccer team. One of his most memorable, and famous quotes is:</p>

<p>“<em>You can find a million and one excuses in life if you want to. I like the excuse it is my fault. I’m going to do something about it!</em>”</p>

<p>So, here are five freedoms, which, if applied in the right way, should help you take back more control over your own lives, and destinies.</p>

<h2 id="you-have-the-freedom-to-reject">You have the freedom to reject!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When you’ve got so many things to do, you can’t help but sometimes feel like a slave to your to-do list! In reality, though, (at least when you’re planning), you actually have the freedom to reject many of the things on that list! And, what’s the fastest way of getting something off that list? Crossing it off without even doing it at all!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can stratify tasks according to what is urgent versus what is not urgent. But that’s not always very effective! A better way is organize your work, life, family, and career, is by what is important versus what is not important.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You might think that by checking off many things on your to-do, you’re being really efficient. But really, you’re just being efficient without really being very effective!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, when you go to the office in the morning, try starting with the most unpleasant, important things first, and try to delay the more enjoyable things, if you get emails about them, till the end of the day. Then, when the end of the day comes, even if you’re feeling tired, having got all the important things out the way, because you’ve delayed the more fun things till the end, you’re still going to have the energy to reply to them!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Defining your values also helps. Just doing this can be an incredibly freeing activity. When you have defined and articulated your values, and have truly understood what they mean, you then have the freedom to reject anything that may not be central to your values! So, even if an opportunity comes your way, if it’s not important to you, you have the freedom to reject it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember, that it takes work to stop working (and to reject things) but if you can be disciplined about this, it can work very well. For example, if you learn how to block a few hours in the week for yourself:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>You can take long brunches without feeling the need to rush off somewhere afterwards.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You can do some exercise without training for a particular event.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You can sit at home, and listen to music, or eat a really good meal and enjoy every bite of it!</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This won’t cross off anything on a to-do list, per se, it won’t satisfy any urgent need, but it may be the most important time you spend all week!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t reply to emails for a full day, you don’t have to be afraid of things getting jammed up. The world isn’t going to stop if you reply, just a day late! Just take a break, you’ve earned it, and reply to those email messages, the next day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="you-have-the-freedom-to-savour">You have the freedom to savour</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You have the freedom to savour your teammates. You should constantly surround yourself by people you think are better than you, that you think have a higher ability than you!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often, when it comes to working in teams, we think we don’t want to be part of a team where we get picked last. But actually, it’s far better to be part of a team where you’re picked last, than it is to be part of a team where you’re picked first – you’ll probably learn a lot more than if you were the star player - your team might just happen to be in a different league!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Obviously, there is a need for some balance! We can’t just savour all the time and not worry about where we’re going, because otherwise we’d just be heading in the wrong direction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>J.K. Rowling once said in her commencement speech to a Harvard class that “<em>it is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which case you will fail by default.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So, if you feel the itch to try something new, then try that something new, which interests you. Even if you don’t think you have any natural ability for it, even if you think you’ll fail for the first couple of times, (obviously you don’t want to fail forever) - you’ll eventually get to a point when you reach a level, when you can really savour your progress, and what you have accomplished!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is no “<em>magic formula</em>” to making a success out of something! It just takes a lot <strong><em>passion</em></strong> and <strong><em>hard work</em></strong>. In fact, all it takes is just a lot of <strong><em>passion</em></strong>, because when you have that passion and real guts to do something, then, all the hard work will come after it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>People often say that Roger Federer has tennis in his DNA. But that is actually a ridiculous thing to say. Physiologically, you cannot have tennis in your DNA. The only way he plays that way is because he put so much practice into Tennis, and consequently, he appears to be a natural to the game.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A professor at Columbia Business School was once interviewed by the Financial Times and asked, “<em>what is your greatest lesson learned?</em>”. She said “<em>you can do everything you want to and be everything you want to be but not all at once.</em>”</p>

    <p>This is also a very important lesson! We live long lives, and it means we can delay certain things, even important things until much later in life, and savour them then! What differentiates humans from computers and robots is that we humans have the natural capacity to learn. We can evolve, and learn, and do new things! You can do different things at different points in your life. You don’t have to do everything all at once.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So you have the freedom to savour things (at the right moments!)</p>

<h2 id="you-have-the-freedom-to-respond">You have the freedom to respond</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Whether you are happy, or unhappy, that’s really your own choice. It is not something that should be dictated by your external circumstances, but rather how you choose to respond to those circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As intelligent human beings, our greatest power is the freedom to choose how we respond. If you’re a reactive person, and it’s sunny or the weather is good, you might feel happy. If the weather is bad, your instant reaction and response might be to feel unhappy. But, proactive people will usually just carry on, regardless of the weather. For proactive people, positivity and contentment is not something that is just a product of their circumstances, but a discipline they work very hard on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you can avoid a “<em>scarcity mentality</em>” – the idea that happiness if a zero-sum game, then you’ll be more focused on your own happiness, and on the values and other things that are important to you, rather than feeling angry, or hard done by, because something didn’t go the way you had planned or hoped.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, you have the freedom to choose how you respond.</p>

<h2 id="you-have-the-freedom-to-serve">You have the freedom to serve!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In good middle-class communities, people still help each other. In those communities, however, subconsciously, before people choose to help somebody or not, they often do some kind of calculation, and will usually think: “<em>Do I get a good reputation out of this?</em>” or, “<em>If I do this now, I might be owed a favor that could be called on later?</em>” Many people do this subconsciously, even though they don’t want to admit it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now, let’s say you agree with this. Let’s say, you do agree with the idea of being free to serve other people. Often, though, the harsh reality is, you might actually have many other things on your plate that you consider to be important. So how can you serve most effectively in this limited time?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The secret to serving effectively, is to give gifts of on equal value - something which is worth far more to the recipient than it is to you! I’m not talking about financial markets, where two financial products might say trade at the same price in a financial market. Life is not a financial market. But when you take the time to do a good deed for say someone who is very underprivileged, often what can be far more important than the actual tangible, or physical gift you gave them, is that you bothered to approach them and take the time to speak to them!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You might think of the idea of helping or serving others as something that is very inefficient - because it can be much easier, than helping somebody directly, to just work for an extra hour, earn a higher bonus, and then write that person a cheque. But, although writing a cheque can be an efficient way of serving, it’s often one of the most ineffective, because far beyond the actual thing you give, the true gift you give, is spending that time in getting to know these other people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to have the freedom to serve effectively then, you should see the gifts you have – your time, talents, and resources - not as gifts to use for whatever purpose you want, but as gifts to use for the benefit of others. If you ask yourself, who are you accountable to, who are you responsible towards? Then, if it is towards future generations, you should try to leave a legacy towards them. If it is towards current generations, then you should try to serve that generation, and be a good example to them.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="you-have-the-freedom-to-do-what-you-love">You have the freedom to do what you love!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Often, when you ask kids these days what they’d like to do when they grow up, they’ll tell you something like a firefighter, an astronaut, or a doctor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But later in life, we often get conditioned into thinking that it’s just too unrealistic to think we can do what we love for a living. We get conditioned by social expectations to earn enough money, to do a job which is respected, and which people will be impressed by if you meet them at a cocktail party. Many also face the pressure to climb the ladder as fast as possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>However, if this is not in accordance with your values and with what’s important to you, then this is not how you should go about living your career and life.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, you have the freedom to love what you do!</p>
