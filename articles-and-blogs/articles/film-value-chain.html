<p>Here, Peter Bloore, Associate Director of the Film Business Academy, provides interesting insight into the value chain of the Independent Film Industry, using well regarded academic concepts to help explain the intricacies and complexities of the industry (as it happens in the real world!), with a particular emphasis on the differences from the US film studio system.</p>

<p>Here are my favorite bits, which I’ve written for my own understanding, but also for the benefit of any interested readers out there…</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In the US, a film is often developed, produced and distributed without leaving a single integrated company – a simple corporate value chain. The independent film production and distribution sector, however is a value system business – feature films are made and delivered by a chain of companies - businesses, freelancers - all working on different elements, adding value in different ways.</p>

<p>Once a film is exploited, money is handed down by the consumer and is subject to various revenue share agreements and commissions (as it passes back through the value chain).</p>

<p>Analytical concepts have become more popular, because of recent changes in the economies of film financing and distribution, which threaten existing business models (trends such as technology convergence, declines in hard format sales, and the rise of digital downloads)</p>

<p>Remember that a key part of business strategy involves aligning an organization with its strategic environment, and why those in the industry should try to fully understand where they fit in the value chain.</p>

<h2 id="the-value-chain">The value chain</h2>

<p>Porter’s value chain is a useful framework for identifying business activities (within a single company) and for analyzing how they affect both a company’s costs and the value delivered to buyers.</p>

<h2 id="the-value-system">The value system</h2>

<p>Some products, however, are not created and delivered by a single end user but by a single company. To accommodate this, Porter created the concept of “value system” – that includes the value chains of separate companies that co-operate within an industry to deliver a final product.</p>

<p>These could include suppliers of raw materials, manufacturers, distributors (channels), and end buyers.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the concept does not in any way attempt to represent the flow of revenue – it is only concerned with how value is added through production and distribution.</p>

<h2 id="the-film-industry">The film industry</h2>

<p>In the independent sector, the production segment involves several intermediary companies and freelancers – that all add financial and artistic value, at different stages. Many have not though, until now, tried to define it as it applies to film.</p>

<h2 id="the-new-model">The new model</h2>

<p>A new model has been developed by <em>Peter Bloore</em>, the author, with the help of several other students at MBA level, with feedback from media business consultants, executives, and film producers (see below).</p>

<h2 id="its-design">Its design</h2>

<p>As with Porter, it is conventional to show the value system as a series of lines or arrows going from left to right, with the customer or end user on the right. This is in keeping with the Western European approach to represent activities that create the value as they occur over the passage of time. Each segment of the chain shows a point where value is added (e.g. where an investment is made, or of how it is exploited).</p>

<h2 id="listing-of-players-in-the-industry">Listing of players in the industry</h2>

<p>Film finance and production is a highly complex and collaborative process. The players named (see diagram below) are listed in order of creative power and influence – with the most popular at the top. Although views on ones creative power and influence may be subjective (as each film varies substantially) – it is a radical addition to previous models, as it allows the value chain to be read not only on these attributes, but on financial value and investment too.</p>

<p>(The order of listing does not reflect their financial input, or entitlements to level of income).</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>The development stage is the process of creating or acquiring an idea for a film, - creating and screenplay (through many drafts), securing funding for the writer, and initiating the production financing process.</p>

<p>Development has been shown as a separate segment to production, as financing for development often comes from a different source. Development can also often be the very definition of an independent film. Having a separate segment also reflects the fact that a lot of time is spent in development.</p>

<p>The chain as a whole shows a clear distance between the development process and the end consumer of the film. Because of this, marketing departments and distributors very rarely influence the creation of films that they eventually exploit. This can sometimes be said to be one of the weaknesses of independent film making.</p>

<h2 id="financing-and-pre-sales">Financing and pre-sales</h2>

<p>This is the stage where film is financed and often involves a range of collaborating businesses, advisors and investors. This is the most complex stage of the process, where leadership and negotiation qualities (of the producer) are most vital in ensuring that multiple stakeholders can say “yes” simultaneously. Pre-sales refers to the process where a film is sold, before being made, on the strength of the perceived value attached to the director and cast.</p>

<h2 id="production-shoot-and-post">Production: Shoot and post</h2>

<p>This is the stage at which a film is shot and edited. Post production includes a whole editing process, including the addition of computer generated special effects and music. The stage is usually the one where the director is most powerful. This power can however reduce during the edit and post production process, since the financiers are concerned with protecting their investment and want to (bless them!) get involved in creative decisions.</p>

<p>Often the director, financiers, and producers will be involved in approving the final edit (but who has final say is often a closely fought contractual issue).</p>

<h2 id="international-sales-and-licensing">International sales and licensing</h2>

<p>This is the point at which the completed film is licensed internationally to distributors in each country or group of countries (territories). The distributors pay to receive the film and have the rights to exploit it over a specified period of time.</p>

<p>Usually the distributors will also return a share of the profit of the distribution back to the original financers of the film (after their distribution costs and advance have been re-couped).</p>

<p>In the independent sector, it is therefore the distributor and not the producer that pays to market the film to the final paying audience. The sales agents though are a critical element to the business-to-business marketing element of the chain.</p>

<p>In the studio system, many international sales are handled through automatic output deals, or it may be that foreign distribution is handled by a subsidiary of the studio</p>

<h2 id="international-distribution--exhibition-and-exploitation">International distribution / exhibition and exploitation</h2>

<p>As described above, this is where the intermediary of the distributor prepares for and delivers the segment of Exhibition and Exploitation in each territory.</p>

<p>The “windows” (or time sensitive opportunities of different types of exploitation) could be: Physical format sales (e.g. Blue Ray, Vinyl’s), PayTV (satellite and cable), Cinema (a.k.a. the Exhibitor), Free TV, Video on Demand (VOD), and finally online download (rent or own). Because of changing business models, this order of value will probably soon change, with physical format sales falling as online and VOD picks up.</p>

<p>Cinema box office is surprisingly not the area of highest value (which surprised me!), and often makes a loss because of the marketing incurred at this stage. In the independent sector, windows are mainly controlled and negotiated by the national distributor (in negotiation with the exhibitor) rather than by the producer.</p>

<p>American film studios try to keep as much control of this stage of the process as possible (because they are big!).</p>

<h2 id="consumption-and-consumer">Consumption and Consumer</h2>

<p>Customers fulfill two objectives here. Firstly the purchasing of the product allows financial value to return down the chain (customer consumption). The second is that the long term “library” value and reputation of the film is highly influenced by the response of: the general audience (box office figures, word of mouth), and critical voices (both formal “approved” media critics, and informal “unapproved” critics) on the internet and website bulletin boards.</p>

<p>Thus, in this way, the consumer could be argued to be participating and adding value, than merely consuming it (very important!)</p>

<h2 id="risk">Risk</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, the earlier you are in the chain, the higher any risk to any capital investor, because of the distance in the re-coupment in the chain from money paid by the consumer. However, in keeping with Porter’s original theory, the value chain diagram does not attempt to actually show the flow of income or re-coupment corridor.</p>

<h2 id="fragmentation-and-integration">Fragmentation and integration</h2>

<p>The model clearly demonstrates, textually and visually, several issues and weaknesses that film insiders have long been aware of, namely:</p>

<p>the large number of collaborating individuals and organizations; the complexity of the multi-player financing process (prone to set backs even when one player drops out); separation of the producer from the distribution and marketing process; the vacillating power of the writer, and the fact that lawyers and accountants seem to have the most stable jobs in the industry (as they earn at every stage of the value chain).</p>

<p>Co-operation along the chain however is not inevitable or casual. Angus Finney, an industry insider, says that because there are so many co-operating players, there is an inherently fragmented chain that can cause disintegration, with an over dependency on the next player.</p>

<p>Risks can also be extreme. The seed idea, early sunk costs in concept development, the writer’s work to produce a realizable screenplay, is six highly complex stages away from contact with the end-user!</p>

<p>Some producers try to also cultivate long-term relationships, with finance companies, sales agents, and distributors, to simplify financing and production processes (very important!), either informally (through ongoing relationships), or formally (through joint ventures, purchases, mergers, output deals) - resulting in better integration and earning money at different points in the chain, rather than just one.</p>

<p>It also results in control of suppliers, distributors, higher profits, better consistency of products, higher control over marketing, and high entry barriers for potential competitors.</p>

<h2 id="retaining-talent">Retaining Talent</h2>

<p>Because of the multi-player and freelance nature of the production business, producers find it difficult to retain key creative talent across many films. The financial power of studios to lure talent away to other film projects is there, especially in America.</p>

<p>Fragmentation increases as new teams are formed for each new film (less continuity from working with the same people), which reduces the ability to learn as a group, build on-going trust, and ensure consistency of product.</p>

<p>It should be said that securing on-going and close relationships with key creative talent (especially writers and directors) should be the key strategic aim of most – as this is more likely to count towards building a strong business with a good track record.</p>

<h2 id="limitations-of-the-model">Limitations of the model</h2>

<p>Key limitations of a static conceptual model such as this include reputation, personal relationships, and timescale, and above all, levels of investment and recoupment at different stages.</p>

<h3 id="reputation">Reputation</h3>

<p>Value chain models do not really show how competitive advantage is gained by those that rely on brand building, soft skills, networks (business is about people after all), specialist skills and knowledge – this is particularly true of film and TV, where great value is placed on experience, trust and personal relationships.</p>

<h3 id="timescale">Timescale</h3>

<p>The value chain can also give a false impression that the same amount of time and effort is spent on each segment (see diagram below). The average time spent on each segment can vary massively, and attempts to transfer this representation to a model can prove clumsy and confusing.</p>

<h2 id="investment-and-recoupment">Investment and Recoupment</h2>

<p>Levels of investment vary a lot from film to film – and a visual representation of the average could be misleading. The value chain above also does not show how players earn their revenue, as not everyone receives income in the same way.</p>

<p>For example, production crews may be paid flat fees up front (from production budgets), before the product is completed.</p>

<p>Some players may also earn revenue from actual sales of finished products (after exhibitors, distributors, and sales agents have taken their expenses and commissions)</p>

<p>Other players (like key acting talent, writers and directors) are entitled to receive both: they are paid flat fees during production, and share in revenue when levels of income are reached and equity investors in primary positions are paid off (they may also receive separate deferral payments during the recoupment schedule).</p>

<p>This is a departure from conventional industries, where a supplier (the anology to an actor) would usually be paid a flat fee, and also not be expected a share of the producing companies profits.</p>

<p>The staged introduction of profit shares, at different moments of the recoupment process interferes with the clarity of accounting process (thereby keeping the accountants busy), disrupts the long-term profitability of the production company and film financiers (keeping the financiers busy!), and consequentially makes it much harder to quantify the ROI on any individual film.</p>

<p>Lastly, because film is different according to the negotiation of individual financing and recoupment structure, the complexity of film finance makes revenue and recoupment very difficult to illustrate within a value chain diagram.</p>

<p>This is not a criticism, though, of the value chain as a concept, as it was not intended to depict or analyze revenue flow (where the money goes!), but only to analyze (study and examine the different parts of) business strategy, competitive advantage, and cost advantage (reducing internal costs in product manufacture, by managing internal and external relationships), and buyer value (by reducing costs and increasing the perception of value for the buyer).</p>

<h2 id="future-of-films">Future of films?</h2>

<p>There are a lot of potential changes to the market for feature films and the value chain – owing to digital technologies and convergence, the expected growth of internet downloads, video on demand, reduction in production costs due to the digitization of the film-making process (especially in ultra-low budget film-making) – to finally the digitization of cinema screens which reduces physical distribution costs, increases the profitability of cinema releases and back catalogues – and allows some producers to market and distribute their films directly for consumer consumption!</p>

<h2 id="other-voices-say">Other voices say:</h2>

<p>“<em>Although the sources and types of costs may be shifting, the overall ratio of investment to return would appear not to be changing, with it likely that overall production levels for feature films and TV programs, will continue to follow already established output patterns</em>” – Vickery and Hawkins (2008)</p>

<h2 id="another-industry-expert-says">Another industry expert says:</h2>

<p>“<em>Ultimately, internet marketing and its growth in sophistication and specific demographic reach, will encourage end-users such as cinema owners and chains, and Pay TV operators to enter the production market themselves.</em>”</p>

<p>Certainly, new devices to play content is proliferating, including mobile phones, portable DVD players, computers, laptops, tablets. Methods for transporting them include high-speed home broadband, wifi networks, ultra portable hard drives, and new high capacity memory sticks.</p>

<p>So there you go!</p>
