<p>When I chose to pursue my MBA, I had several objectives in mind: I knew that after working in the professional services industry for a few years that I wanted to broaden my horizons and develop a better commercial understanding of business. I also knew that I wanted to grow my professional business network by working with people of different cultural backgrounds and experiences, and that doing an MBA, would, in someway, help me achieve this. What I didn’t realize, however, was just how truly transformational the experience would be!</p>

<p>Though not quite like ‘<em>drinking water from a firehose</em>’, the course load is intense, particularly if you haven’t been used to doing academic work for sometime. Keeping pace with the classroom case studies, writing reports, preparing for client presentations, sitting the various course exams, organising study group sessions, socializing – even with the weekends - it’s challenging juggling all the workloads, and there’s only so many midnight oils you can burn!</p>

<p>So how has the MBA been transformational for someone like me?</p>

<h2 id="the-projects">The Projects</h2>

<p>The projects have certainly been an important part of my experience. Not only do you get to work in new and challenging industries; you really do get pushed to take on things outside of your comfort zone!</p>

<p>In my first term, for example, I remember working on a Non-for-Profit business project for a small chain of local nurseries to develop the marketing strategy. For someone who had worked most of their early career in engineering, and then finance, it was the type of business I had never before been involved in. Importantly, for me, it was a clear demonstration of how, by applying some of the principles taught from our business school’s marketing classes, we could work with a local organisation to make a real societal impact.</p>

<p>Since that first project, we have had many other opportunities to apply our class teachings in marketing, negotiations, and corporate finance to several other exciting projects: For example, a Consulting project for a UK SME that provides traditional and luxury long-haul travel products; an M&amp;A project that got us searching for, and valuing potential acquisition targets and their potential synergies with a FTSE 100 company in the foods and beverage industry; to a Negotiations project that saw us develop a business model, write a business plan and pitch an innovative business idea for the UK retail industry, to a small venture capital company.</p>

<p>I distinctly remember the very moment, waking up on one Sunday morning, and discovering just how, after our project surveys had gone out live nationally, we had achieved in a little under 2 days, the number of responses we thought would take a whole 2 weeks! The client was really delighted with our work on that project. Later that month, I then saw them broadcast their first commercial advert on prime-time TV, which was absolutely great to see.</p>

<h2 id="the-people">The People</h2>

<p>Along with the projects, some of my best learning’s came from my MBA classmates. In a class of 33 different nationalities, I found myself working with people from as far as <em>Brazil</em>, <em>Korea</em>, <em>Romania</em>, <em>Egypt</em>, and <em>Japan</em>, as well as with those who had come from backgrounds that, in the traditional sense, some might consider quite unrelated to business - such as: <em>The Royal Airforce &amp; Armed Forces</em>, and <em>The National Health Service</em>.</p>

<p>Having group discussions and debates with such a diverse group of people, who could draw from their own unique personal experiences, proved to be particularly stimulating, and not something that I felt could be taught passively from just a classroom course.</p>

<p>When trying to attack some of the problems the business school had thrown at us, for example, I felt the very diverse team nature, helped us generate many more ideas than I alone would have been able generate. This resulted in better, far more superior solutions!</p>

<p>These interactions, personally, broadened my own thinking. It taught me the importance of being able to put across an idea or argument simply and convincingly, and also changed my working style, in terms of how I present, participate in, and manage meetings, ensuring that people, no matter what their background or personality type are <em>ALL</em> able to participate and contribute. On the whole, it was a great experience in leadership development, and, it has been great too, to see everyone around me develop in the same way.</p>

<h2 id="the-flexibility">The Flexibility</h2>

<p>While the first year was a steep learning experience for all of us, given our very varied experiences, I now look forward to a slightly different year, where we will all have the flexibility, and greater freedom to choose our own electives, thus allowing us to start establishing a better industry and sector focus.</p>

<p>With so many electives to choose from, I have opted for those that would allow me to best build on my earlier experiences, maximize my commercial understanding of business, but importantly, provide expose to industries of greatest interest to me.</p>

<p>So far, I have enjoyed taking a class in Advanced Strategic Management, where I was able to study some of the trends in the Media &amp; Entertainment industry – how, a company such as Walt Disney, for example, has – through careful management of its portfolio – been able to overcome some of the challenges being faced in the Media &amp; Entertainment industry. In the same class I also got the opportunity to study some of the emerging trends in the Automotive industry, and how recent developments in electric cars have been affecting the corporate and business strategies of companies such as BMW.</p>

<h2 id="the-2nd-year">The 2nd Year!</h2>

<p>For the rest of the 2nd year, I look forward to taking further classes in <em>Corporate Turnaround and Recovery</em>, <em>Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity</em>, <em>Digital Economy: Foundations and Strategy</em>, and other similarly modern, relevant, and practical courses. If I get the time, continuing on with the international theme of the MBA programme, I may also try to brush up on my Japanese, or learn one of the many other language electives the school also has to offer, which should be great fun!</p>

<p>So, as I reflect on the year just gone, the MBA has - without a doubt - been a transformational experience; not just for someone with an early career background in engineering and finance, in allowing me to develop a broader range of new skills, obtain new learnings &amp; insights from the various practical project work, but also in helping me to demonstrate and develop my own entrepreneurial, presentation and leadership skills, by working in experienced, diverse, and multi-cultural teams.</p>

<p>It should be another challenging and exciting year, one where I can make the most of the opportunities available to me, take electives tailored to my own interests, continue to learn a vast array of business skills, disrupt conventional business paradigms, and continue to cultivate lifelong friendships with some great people, which, after all, is what makes the MBA such a remarkable experience!</p>
