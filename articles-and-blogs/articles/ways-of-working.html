<h2 id="i-like-to-get-things-done-and-done-fairly-quickly">I like to get things done, and done fairly quickly</h2>

<p>I would like to be known as a person who can bring impact and positive change. Although I’m very commercially minded, what inspires me is the desire to leave the world in a better place than how I found it. I have a bias towards action, which means I think that making a wrong decision, and then correcting it, is better than no decision. We can always talk about what worked, and what didn’t, afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="i-like-to-think-a-lot-about-what-motivates-other-people">I like to think a lot about what motivates other people</h2>

<p>I believe we’re all more likely to succeed if people feel happy, motivated, and stretched. I enjoy collaborative, and honest relationships, and I’ll try lots of different ways to make the relationship work, if it doesn’t feel mutually beneficial, collaborative, or trustworthy. I’m more likely to be kept awake at night by a poor human interaction than a delivery screw-up!</p>

<h2 id="im-a-natural-completer--finisher">I’m a natural ‘completer / finisher’</h2>

<p>I like to see things through from start to finish. I’m a logical, and detailed-driven person, and like understanding the detailed structure of things, and how things work, but I am also a people person!</p>

<p>The former means, I sometimes have difficulty letting go, so I need to feel confident I can trust other people to their own roles. One of the best ways, I believe, of doing this, is to allow people to show me that they care about the details and that they don’t let things drop when things get hard, or if they do, that they’re not afraid to ask for help.</p>

<p>I also like working with people who think beyond just task delivery, who try to own and provide challenge to how things can be done better. I think allowing people to be given the space and freedom to speak up, and grow, should be in all our job descriptions. If people come to me with a problem to solve, I will first ask them what they think the solution is, and then, how I think I can help them work towards delivering it.</p>

<h2 id="meetings-should-always-be-about-moving-forward">Meetings should always be about moving forward</h2>

<p>Everyone’s time is precious, so meetings should be as short as possible. I think this can achieved by making sure everyone has been given a chance to prepare and come ready with a point of view.</p>

<p>I like to see an agenda in advance, with details of what people are looking to address. If it’s another person’s meeting, I also like to be very clear about why we’re in the room and what decisions or actions should be taken before everyone leaves.</p>

<p>Towards the end of meetings, I would also encourage people to summarise the meeting afterwards and to send around any necessary actions to attendees. I also hope that people are intentional with their time. If people think they don’t need to be there, I think they should have the courage and confidence to say so.</p>

<h2 id="people-should-take-the-lead-in-any-one-to-ones">People should take the lead in any one-to-ones</h2>

<p>When I’m working with others, I want to be there to help and unblock, not to directly manage or very closely direct.</p>

<p>I would encourage people into any one-to-ones, to try and be ready to let me know what I can do to free up their time and help them get things done, efficiently, effectively, (and safely!)</p>

<p>If they think something is important, they don’t have to wait till the next meeting to discuss it with me. Even if I might look busy, they can always swing by my desk or office with questions!</p>

<h2 id="career-planning-should-be-a-dialogue">Career planning should be a dialogue</h2>

<p>I think career discussions should not just centre on what you can do for an organisation, but also on whether people are happy in their role and feel like they’re growing and making a valued contribution.</p>

<p>While I can help people to understand what a business might expect of them, their objectives should be their own, shaped and guided by their mentors and people managers, or other people they closely know and trust.</p>

<p>Often, I think it would be great for them to lead the conversation on how they think they are progressing. As part of this, I would encourage them to be as intellectually honest and open as possible, about, for example, why they think things might have gone well, or why they didn’t.</p>

<p>This will help them better identify the actions they need to take to become stronger in the areas they are weak, and define a more impactful personal development plan, that can help them think more about their own career ambitions, even if that means changing roles, or thinking about a role outside with another organisation.</p>

<h2 id="i-set-rules-for-myself--other-people-should-do-so-too">I set rules for myself – other people should do so too</h2>

<p>I’ve learned to set boundaries to help me focus on what’s important. Since I’m not generally with non-work friends during the day, when I do get to spend time with them, I won’t spend it answering work emails.</p>

<p>I would try to leave the office at 7.30pm most days (if I’m in the office), and when I get home, I would leave my phone by the door. Once I’m done with the tasks of the evening, I would spend my time catching up on the day. I would work every other Friday, if I need to, from home, and also avoid working weekends if I can.</p>

<p>At the beginning of every day, I would scan my meetings and make sure I’m prepared for all of them.</p>

<p>In my to do lists, in my notebook, I might keep two lists; the first for urgent tasks, the second for priorities and important tasks.</p>

<p>I find this helps me to get the right balance and avoids always rushing from fire to fire. Also, I would ensure that I keep at least two hours of ‘thinking time’ free in my diary, every other day.</p>

<p>I have quite a relaxed email style, so people shouldn’t be surprised if they receive a one-line message from me. I’m not being rude, I’m just trying to be quick. If I send other people an email at 8pm, that doesn’t mean I expect a reply right then, I respect people’s personal time, but if I have requested others to do something, then I would expect a timely response, just to let me know that they are working on it.</p>

<p>On the Myerr Briggs self-report questionnaire that assesses Personality Types, when I took the questionnaire 5 years ago, I could best classify myself as a ‘<strong>ITSJ</strong>’ personality type. This meant I bordered from being more ‘introverted’ than ‘extroverted’; preferred making decisions using more of a ‘thinking’ style; preferred taking in information through more of a ‘sensing’ style; and then preferred to live my life with more of a ‘judging’ style.</p>

<p>I think now, with the 5 years that have passed, the ‘introversion’ may have moved closer to ‘extroversion’,‘thinking’ closer to a ‘feeling’ style, ‘sensing’ closer to a more ‘intuitive’ style, and ‘judging’ closer to a more ‘perceptive’ style. So, I now think of myself as having more of an <strong>‘EFNP’</strong> personality type.</p>

<p>Then, on the Belbin Team roles, I might describe myself as more of a Completer Finisher – <a href="https://www.belbin.com/about/belbin-team-roles/" target="_blank">Belbin Team Inventory (Team Roles)</a></p>

<p>When I’m stressed, I might have a tendency to micromanage and direct others rather than delegate. I know this can be frustrating, and I’m working hard on learning when to ‘let go’. And if others feel I’m not getting the balance right, I would ask them to speak up and let me know.</p>

<h2 id="feedback-is-critical-to-creating-a-great-culture">Feedback is critical to creating a great culture</h2>

<p>I know it’s not always easy to give or receive feedback. When I’m giving feedback, I try to make it considered and honest, and evidenced with specific examples.</p>

<p>Because it isn’t always easy to hear, I hope other people take it constructively.</p>

<p>I always welcome other peoples’ feedback. I’m quite a perfectionist, which means if others have some developmental feedback, it’s likely I’ve had a word with myself about it already.</p>

<p>My golden rule is that you should only write down what you’d be happy to say constructively, directly, to someone else in person.</p>

<h2 id="always-be-passionate-about-what-you-do">Always be passionate about what you do</h2>

<p>We spend half our time at work, and I don’t think there is any point doing that if you don’t enjoy what you do. I wouldn’t expect other people to work all hours, but I would expect them to care enough not to walk away.</p>

<p>People should be true to themselves. I would never apologise for leaving the office at 7:30, but I’m not sure I could do my job well unless I picked things up again in the evenings, or worked some of the weekend. That’s my choice, because I think it’s important to focus on delivering brilliantly, regardless of when you do it!</p>
