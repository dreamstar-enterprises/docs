<h2 id="freelance-experiences">Freelance experiences</h2>

<p>After finishing my MBA 2.5 years ago (at the time of writing), I felt the time might be right to see what it might be like to work as a freelancer through my own company. It was not something I had ever done before, but it was also a tentative choice, as it is something a lot of people think, only people much later in their careers go on to do. For me, I was partly very curious about what it took to start a company, but it was also partly driven by Market circumstances at the time (the UK economy and existing UK businesses were going through a tough time with the Brexit vote and its transistion). I saw some major benefits working as a freelancer though: greater freedom and flexibility, but also more personal control over the types of projects and assignments I could apply to work on, in industries and with companies I was most passionate about. I really felt that there would be a lot to learn, and that really appealed to me!</p>

<p>So, that’s exactly what I went ahead and did! I set up my own limited company, and started working as a freelancer, applying and working with companies in sectors that piqued my interest the most.</p>

<p>And over the 2.5 years gone past (since the end of my MBA in April 2016), I’ve been able to work with some amazing people on some incredible projects (in areas that have overlapped Business Strategy, Finance, Human Resource Management, and “<strong><em>Data Visualisation &amp; Business Intelligence</em></strong>”), for several companies in both the UK and abroad. And somehow, I’ve still managed stay to stay in business doing what I enjoy!</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the amazing project experiences I have been lucky enough to work on, which I thought I would share:</p>

<h2 id="jaguar-land-rover-automotives---project-1">Jaguar Land Rover, Automotives - Project 1</h2>

<p>This was work for one of the UK’s leading Automotive Companies, Jaguar Land Rover, a car company that employs over 37,000 people, and turns over £24bn in annual revenue.</p>

<p>Here I was able to work in the company’s Product Finance team and significantly reduce the complexity, and improve the efficiency of the work they carried out. It was a critical role as the team were responsible for tracking the location of all Jaguar Land Rover vehicles over the world - right from when they roll off the factory floor, to when they left the factory gates, to when they were then transported to any one of the thousands of National and International Distribution Centres or Dealerships across the globe.</p>

<p>I was able to improve the way work was done, so that tasks that would otherwise have taken members of the desk 9-10 days to complete, after much significant simplification and some software automation, could be done in less than 3 days! For things the team just didn’t know how to do, or where to start, I also coached them on how to create better process documents so they were easier to follow and update.</p>

<h2 id="the-landmark-group-retail---project-2">The Landmark Group, Retail - Project 2</h2>

<p>Outside the Automotive Industry, this project was for one of the largest multi-national retailers in the Middle East, one with over 500+ retail stores, and with a presence across over 21 countries.</p>

<p>Here, with close support from the company’s employees, I was able to create a complete, and comprehensive MI reporting solution, that gave the company’s procurement department a much better overall picture into how the department’s budget was being spent. They were able to see, for the first time, and much more quickly and accurately, areas such as (i) contract vs non-contract spend; (ii) purchase request approval times; and (iii) spend by different buyers on different vendors which helped with supplier negotiations. It was a amazing project - one that The Department Heads, and other company Senior Executives were really impressed with, and one that I got great compliments for.</p>

<h2 id="happy-ratio-fmcg---project-3">Happy Ratio, FMCG - Project 3</h2>

<p>Away from the multi-nationals, this project was for a fast-growing international start-up developing a new kind macro-nutrient health drink, in India. The company had been doing amazingly well, selling in several cities across the country through both online and offline channels.</p>

<p>When the company started exploring the idea of selling internationally, they began engaging in talks and negotiations with wholesale distributors in the Middle East, and they called me to see if I could help them develop a scenario and sensitivity model they could use, to more easily see how far they could go in reducing prices pricing negotiation, and yet still be able to make a worthwhile profit. Since delivering the project, the company has gone on to experience continued success, with now manufacturing operations in Spain.</p>

<h2 id="jl-rohatgi-eye-hospital---project-4">JL Rohatgi Eye Hospital - Project 4</h2>

<p>This project was work in the healthcare industry, for a District Eye Hospital. Here, from scratch, working with the Hospital’s Administrative Department, I was able to develop a completely new M.I. reporting system for that gave them, for the first time, much better reports on the financial performance of their different Hospital Units.</p>

<p>After having done my work, instead of having to wait months just to get the right report, they could prepare the required reports within a matter of just 2 to 3 days - to see, for example, which Hospital units were performing well, whcih ones not so well, where the growth opportunities were, and importantly, which areas were in need of greater investment. They liked the work so much that they called me back to do similar work for them the following year, as demand for their services had rapidly picked up!</p>

<h2 id="wpp-marketing--advertising---project-5">WPP, Marketing &amp; Advertising - Project 5</h2>

<p>This was a 12 month project at WPP, the global marketing and communication agency, at their offices in London, working across their Finance and HR departments. The projects were fun, varied and engaging!</p>

<p>I got to work with several country, regional, and global CFOs, in the Finance department of a few agencies to design and implement better Financial Reporting solutions, so the agencies could more quickly see how they was performing in terms of their: Actual, Budgeted, and Forecast: Sales, Profits, and Margins, Net Working Capital, and Sales-to-Profit conversion ratios.</p>

<p>In the HR department of Wunderman Thompson, I also got to investigate and resolve several process failures around the transparency and review of salary raise requests across the EMEA region, by implementing and designing better processes, that would more accurate, more robust, and parts of which could be automated. I was able to provide the agency’s UK offices and all of its global agencies too, with much clearer guidance, and instructions on how their HR deparments should put through their salary raise requests.</p>

<p>I was also able to design and develop reports that provided the agency, for the first time, insights into Gender Pay to ensure that there was a better equality of pay. The report covered areas such as: Staff Headcounts, Average and Median Staff Salaries, Years of Service, and Annual Compensation Ratios, by Gender, and Department.</p>

<p>I received very positive feedback from all the CFOs and HR Directors for my work, so much so that they ended up extending my contract from initially only 3 months, 3 times, to a full year!</p>

<h2 id="corporate-venture-capital-firm-venture-capital---project-6">Corporate Venture Capital Firm, Venture Capital - Project 6</h2>

<p>On this project I was able to work for a FTSE 100 Corporate Venture Fund, to help them to automate certain workflows so they could more quickly and accurately see the financial performance of their portfolio companies.</p>

<p>It was an exciting Venture Capital firm to work with - they were investing in innovative drinks start-ups that aspired tp become global drinks brands! So, it was just an incredible privilege and honor to get the chance to work with that kind of company and be able to do great work for them! Thankfully, they really liked my work too!</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>I have been working as a freelancer on projects in areas that have worked between Finance, Human Resource Management, Business Strategy, and “<strong><em>Data Visualisation &amp; Business Intelligence</em></strong>” with decent success for the past 2.5 years, and is something I hope to be able to continue to do, at least for the next few years in some capacity.</p>

<p>Personally, I have found working with Senior Business Leaders, and the various people that work in different deparments, to more efficiently report on their business data, and extract new insights, really rewarding and fascinating.</p>

<p>I’ve been grateful to have been given opportunities to challenge and give constructive input into the way certain things are done, so that whatever the task in hand may be, it can be improved on in some way, and give the relevant people (stakeholders) sufficient time to make balanced, and considered business decisions, and be confident in these decisions.</p>

<p>So far, the more I have learnt, the more enjoyment I have gained from being able to work with other people to solve ever more challenging ‘real-world’ problems - in both small and large companies - So why stop?</p>

<p>I think the fields of “<strong><em>B.I., Data Visualiation, Data Analytics, Data Engineering, and Data Science</em></strong>” will be an evolving and growing ones, (definitely for the next few years), as the data requirements of businesses grow, and as many more businesses still struggle to meet with their own data needs.</p>

<p>So, for someone with my experience and skills, I hope there will still be lots of exciting projects out there, where I can work with some great people, in some exciting companies! My Fingers will always be crossed!</p>
