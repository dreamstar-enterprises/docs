<p>A big thanks to Harsh Batra (Vice President of Ethos Data) for arranging this! And also to all the other great people - colleagues, coaches, mentors, and friends - I’ve had the opportunity to work with so far in my career!</p>

<p>Sachin Tandon is one of the smartest and humblest guys I have ever known. In this wide ranging conversation, we go back in time, to unravel his career journey to date - how, and why, he ended up studying and working at the places he did (at some very well-known institutions across the world), and then after some years working as a company employee, took the big leap into independent freelancing, to see if that is where he could work on problems and coming up with great solutions for the companies and industries he was most passionate about.</p>

<p>I personally see him as a collector of experiences. Someone with a strong foundation of skills - that takes decades to acquire - but underlying it all, a childish curiosity to want to keep learning and keep growing - with humility, focus, and gratitude at its very core.</p>

<p>The skill sets, and dimension of understanding he brings to businesses, in his freelancing capacity, is something very unique to the business universe! If you get the opportunity to work with him, I’d say you, and your business, are very lucky!</p>

<p>You can read all about him, in this interview below. It’s quite lengthy, but very comprehensive read, and definitely all worth it!</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Harsh Batra - (VP of Ethos Data)</p>

<p>In this one to one, Sachin Tandon talks through some of his career highlights to date: from his early experiences in Business Consulting, Assurance, and Finance at PwC, in London, to his then later endevours with International Commerce at Manchester Business School, to then some of his more recent entrepreneurial stints, working with companies such as Jaguar Land Rover, WPP, Diageo, the Omnicom Media Group.</p>

<p>Sachin currently freelances through his own small company, with the mission of wanting to “<em>to support businesses around the world – whether they be small and innovative start-ups, medium-sized companies, or large multi-nationals – to achieve more!</em>” – He particularly focuses on those companies in the Technology &amp; Engineering, and Media &amp; Entertainment sectors as ones that interest him the most.</p>

<p>He has had quite “<strong><em>non-linear</em></strong>” career path to date. After completing a degree in General Engineering at the University of Cambridge, U.K., and then M.I.T., Boston, U.S., he began his graduate career at the Professional Services firm, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC), in London. After a few years here, he did his MBA from Manchester Business School, before then taking the very “entrepreneurial leap”, of turning his home into his own start-up / freelancing headquarters, to pursue what he felt like, was a small gap in the market, and also growing area of interest for him.</p>

<p>What follows is a transcript of my conversation with Sachin, where along with some his career highlights, he shares some important life lessons, and tells us how it’s all going, and what he hopes to do next.</p>

<p><strong>Sachin thanks for taking the time to do this!</strong></p>

<p>Hello Harsh! Thanks for having me!</p>

<p><strong>So, Sachin, just looking at your career history to date, you’ve definitely gone on and done a lot of different things - more than I might possibly say of most – but it’s clear to me at least, that you have taken a strong liking to business. As a younger boy, when you were growing up, did you always have an ambition to get into business? Was it something always on the radar when you were coming through the schooling system you grew up in?</strong></p>

<p>No, not really. When I was young, I was always quite focused on my schoolwork. Outside school, in my free time, I used to watch a lot of films by Stephen Spielberg, and read books by H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, Isaak Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke. I thought one day, I wanted to learn more about what Film Directors did, or some create whacky flying gadget, or flying machine, and become some kind of Engineering Rocket Scientist. But then also, after watching TV series like Ally McBeal, and Due South, I thought I might want to become some kind of Lawyer, or be a Mounty Police Officer, with a Siberian Husky, called Diefenbaker.</p>

<p>Then having become fascinated with Technology, and by what Engineers do, when I was 18 - I did my Gap Year, and many of my University internships with Engineering companies, carrying out research and conducting experiments in dedicated Engineering research labs, like what say, many Engineering Rocket Scientists might do. Then after 5 years of that, I decided I wanted to still do innovative and creative things, but in other ways too, from new perspectives, and explore how this could be done from other business functions too - which is how I found myself wanting to learn more about areas such as Finance, Accounting, and Tax, and then after that, in areas such as Marketing, and Human Resources, and so on, from when I did my MBA - again just to understand how I could best help other people – which is what I think a successful career in business is <em>really</em> all about!</p>

<p><strong>That’s great. You’ve achieved quite a lot in your career so far – and I see gone on to some pretty impressive places, and done work equally impressive. What, in your own mind, do you think you would put your success down to?</strong></p>

<p>Well, if I had to name just one thing, it would be tenacity!</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I’ve recognised the importance of dealing with both success and failure. And where I’ve met with success, I’ve tried to build on those successes, but just as importantly, whenever I’ve failed, I’ve always tried to ensure I’ve learnt from these experiences – so I can “<em>bounce back</em>”, learn from them, and have another go!</p>

<p>That <strong><em>tenacity</em></strong> (or <strong><em>perseverance</em></strong>, if you will), along with the ability to communicate <strong><em>clearly</em></strong>, with <strong><em>empathy</em></strong>, and form <strong><em>strong relationships</em></strong> with people, I would say have been the critical success factors to any life and work success I think I’ve had so far.</p>

<p>I remember once, in a work interview, I was once asked: what is the one trait I would most like to be remembered for. And, at the time I can remember saying: “<strong><em>Just never giving up</em></strong>”. I think that one trait has and always be something I will carry with me.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Sachin! Do you think it is these qualities that have allowed you to get on well with the people you have worked with so far?</strong></p>

<p>I think it was one of the really important things, for definite.</p>

<p>When I think about the people I really admire and look up to, we often both have a number of things in common, but also a number of things that are different too. But that idea of “<strong><em>Just never giving up</em></strong>”, and always “<strong><em>Striving for excellence</em></strong>” are qualities we both have often shared.</p>

<h2 id="university---engineering">University - Engineering</h2>

<p><strong>I see that after your primary and secondary schooling, you went to University, and did a Master’s Degree in Manufacturing Engineering. After school, why did you decide to do that and pursue Higher Education? How was it?</strong></p>

<p>For me, I just saw going to University as a natural next step from the Further Education and Schooling System I had grown up in. I had worked hard (put in a lot of time, energy, and effort) into my “A-level” subjects, and then early on in my second year at Sixth Form College, knew that I was also on track to getting high grades in the subjects I had taken.</p>

<p>At the time, my thinking was that I wanted to follow in my Father’s and Grandfather’s footsteps and pursue my Higher Education in Engineering. Both my Dad and Grandfather had studied Engineering when they went to college. Both had worked as Engineers too early on in their careers.</p>

<p>My Grandfather was a Civil Engineer and used to design and build Hydro-Electric dams in India in the 1970s and 1980s, because he aspired to reduce the country’s reliance on Fossil Duels.</p>

<p>My Father started his career working as a Chemical Engineer for companies here in the U.K. like Dunlop, and Slazenger, designing innovative Tennis balls and Tennis racquets – Racquets that were made from lighter composite materials, and Tennis Balls filled with more complex gases that made them more durable, last longer and bounce better. After Dunlop, he then worked for some years at companies such as: Bowater, Rexam, and Bonnar, to help them design and make polythene rolls – those used for wrapping the Bales of Hay you see dotted around the English countryside, before then moving onto a more International career in General Management.</p>

<p>So, aspiring to follow a similar path, I thought I too would want to go to a well-known University, to read Engineering - one that was well-resourced, had a good facilities, and admitted a lot of motivated, smart, and ambitious students, who I could learn a lot from.</p>

<p>After doing some research, I saw that Cambridge was highly ranked in the University League Tables, and that both its Engineering course, and Undergraduate Teaching had a strong global reputation. I was also left with a positive impression after visiting them on an Open-Day. So, I decided to try my luck and apply. Then, after a couple of interviews, I was lucky enough to be accepted onto their 4 Year Masters of Engineering programme, at the college, Gonville &amp; Caius.</p>

<p>As to how it was, overall, I had a really enjoyable time. My college, Gonville &amp; Caius was one of the smaller ones – but still very idyllic, and picturesque. It was conveniently located close to the City Centre, where all the shops were, and wasn’t very far either from the University’s main Engineering department.</p>

<p>The college itself had a very nice, close-knit, community feel to it. Our supervisors and professors were really wonderful people - very passionate about teaching, knowledgable about the subjects they taught, and about the well-being of the students. Gonville &amp; Caius college itself had a very diverse mix of International students, with students that read not just Engineering, but subjects ranging all the way from: Medicine, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Languages, Music, Economics, Philosophy, Computer Science, to the Classics, and English Literature.</p>

<p>It even had, what some people in the U.K. today might call, mini celebrities – for example, I remember meeting Stephen Hawking, the Theoretic Physicist and Cosmologist, a few times; he was an Honorary fellow of the college. Then, I think Ken Clark, the Conservative Party politician, and for a brief time, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, was also a student of Gonville &amp; Caius, where he had read for a degree in Law.</p>

<p>But going back to what my degree, I would say the Engineering course at Cambridge University was very tough – very theoretical, and underpinned by a lot of very advanced Maths - where we were challenged to solve a lot of very complex Engineering problems (tested through Example Papers, or P-Sets, as they then used to call them).</p>

<p>Because I did quite well in my first and second years, in my third year, I was selected to go on to attend the competitive exchange program at the Technology Institute, M.I.T. in Boston, the U.S.A. – which was another great experience. After that, I then returned to the U.K. to complete my fourth and final year.</p>

<p>Apart from the lectures and classroom teachings, I found the various lab practicals and company industrial visits, to be very enjoyable and interesting. Academically, overall, I graduated with a 1st class – which is something I was very, very proud of.</p>

<p>So, yes, overall, an all-round great experience!</p>

<h2 id="professional-services---pwc">Professional Services - PwC</h2>

<p><strong>Well, Sachin, that sounds really amazing! It certainly sounds like you had an enjoyable time - lots of hard work, lots of study, but also a lot of opportunity to work with some very diverse, smart and driven people. After you graduated, I see your first full time work experiences were with PwC. How did you end up taking your first steps in the working world, with them?</strong></p>

<p>As with anything, mostly from the opportunities I had been looking for at the time. As graduate, I wanted to try and start my career working for a well-known, well-established, global company, somewhere that would provide me with a strong platform and foundation from which I could build on.</p>

<p>I had enjoyed some of my earlier Research &amp; Development experiences during my gap year (after Sixth Form College and before University), and over the summers, when I was at University. I got to work for companies such as: Renishaw, a High Tech Engineering Company, near Bristol, and then after that, the National Broadcasting &amp; Media Company, the BBC, at their Central Communications and Technology department, in London.</p>

<p>On my degree itself, I had also enjoyed some of the “<em>Engineering Consultancy</em>” projects I got to work on. I got to visit various just-in-time factories at companies such as: Coty Lipsticks, IMI Norgren, and Rolls Royce, in the U.K., and then later, with Hitachi GST, in Japan - to help improve different aspects of their Manufacturing activities – such as reducing assembly line changeover times, achieving better assembly line balancing, reducing WIP &amp; Inventory levels, reducing lead times, trying to increase product throughput rates, and so on.</p>

<p>When, towards the end of my degree, the time came to start thinking about what I might want to do next, many of those close to me (my family, close friends and classmates, etc.) had encouraged me to consider applying for a full-time role in the field of “<em>Management Consultancy</em>” – to see if that was something that might interest me. There would be some overlap with the skills I had developed and Engineering experiences I had gained during my degree, but it would also provide me with a newer, and slightly different perspective into business, given my, uptil then, only very Research &amp; Development like experiences. Because I was interested in broadening and deepening my experiences, and also learning more about business, I thought, why not, I’d give it a try?</p>

<p>So, that’s what I had started to focus my job application efforts on. After applying to a few places in my 3rd year, I received an offer to work, in my penultimate summer (the summer before the start of my final year at University), at a company called PwC, in their “<em>Transaction Advisory</em>” department, in a small division called “<em>The Strategy Group</em>”.</p>

<p>I had an enjoyable time – it was quite different to my earlier gap year, and internship experiences, but still interesting work – doing desk-based “<em>Commercial Due Diligence</em>” research on different kinds of companies.</p>

<p>The particular division I worked in, “<em>The Strategy Group</em>”, would often get its work from other outside Investment Companies in London. These companies would often approach our division, because they needed an independent team, such as ours, to carry out some market research on a particular target company they were interested in buying. (e.g. to better understand what products and services the target company sold, what its positioning was vis a vis its closest competitors, what the latest market trends and developments affecting the company were, what customer’s opinions about the company were, and what regulatory developments might affect the company’s future growth).</p>

<p>At the end of that summer, I had been given an offer to work for them full time. Because I didn’t want to start my fourth year at University without a firm job offer in hand, I accepted their offer to work for them when I would graduate. Amongst other things, I felt that having an offer in hand after the end of my 3rd year, would allow me focus more on the course materials of my 4th year. It also allowed me to spend more time planning and preparing for a Manufacturing Engineering Project trip to Japan - where I had gone to work for Hitachi GST for 10 weeks, near Tokyo, on an interesting just-in-time factory automation project. So, I was quite content with all the decisions I had made.</p>

<p><strong>Again, really great to hear Sachin. Just after you graduated, how did you feel before you moved down from Cambridge to London? I imagine you must have been both quite excited, but also a little nervous, about starting your first full time job?</strong></p>

<p>Well, yes, that’s very true. I felt both excited, but also a little nervous and anxious.</p>

<p>Excited because I knew PwC were considered as one of the top graduate employers in the country, quite well-known in many areas of business. I used to often see and hear in the news, news reporters quoting statements from Market Research reports that had been written and published by PwC.</p>

<p>I also knew that PwC were a global company, with a large network of international offices, so it would mean opportunities too of working on projects, with people from very different backgrounds and countries, all very motivated to work and learn, which I also saw as a plus!</p>

<p>The offer too was in London, which I was excited about. The city is considered to be a thriving epicentre for business. With more commerce and companies, there are also more opportunities for career development and progression. Away from business, the city itself is also very diverse and cosmopolitan, with no shortage of things for someone in their mid 20s to do!</p>

<p>But, yes, you’re absolutely right, I was a bit nervous too. But I think this is only natural, and happens whenever someone starts a new job, moves to different city or place, and meets new people for the first time. There are so many new things to find out, there are lots of things you have to learn, very, very quickly. It all takes time to settle in.</p>

<p><strong>So, you started at PwC, working in a division called “The Strategy Group”, in the companies “Transaction Advisory” department, doing mostly “Commercial Due Dilligence” work, for external Investment Companies (PE firms, VC firms, sometimes listed Corporates). Then later, I see you started working towards obtaining a Chartered Qualification in Finance &amp; Accountancy. How did that come about?</strong></p>

<p>Well, yes, that’s exactly right. I started with company’s “The Strategy Group” division (where I had worked at in an earlier summer internship) doing “Commercial Due Diligence” work, for Investment Companies.</p>

<p>But as I meet more people from other departments (those closest to mine were the “Financial Due Diligence”, and “Market Valuation &amp; Strategy” divisions) and learnt more about what they did, that’s when I discovered how quite a lot of them held or were working towards a “Chartered Qualification” – and that many of them were going through an extra structured training course to try and obtain one. So I became curious.</p>

<p>From a long-term career standpoint, I had always felt that getting some kind of Chartered Qualification would stand me in good stead. The CA, the Qualification that PwC encourages many of its employees to do is: a well-respected business qualification; internationally very well recognised; and teaches you some of the key skills needed to run a successful business - in Finance &amp; Accoutancy, Tax, and Business Law. I saw it as an opportunity to learn more about things I never really knew much about and would never otherwise get much of an opportunity to learn.</p>

<p>I didn’t see anything wrong with work I was doing on “Commercial Due Dilligence” assignments. I had become better and better at that for about 18 months. But I felt that my natural interests at that time were starting to gravitate towards solving the kind of complex “Financial” problems that I saw people in the other departments, with CAs, get to work on.</p>

<p>And the more research I did on the Qualification, and of what one would learn, the more and more intrigued I became.So, after doing what I felt was enough research, I decided to ask some of the Partners in my division whether it would be possible for me to pursue a CA with them. Many of the Partners knew how easily bored I would get without a tough challenge on my hands, and what my natural strengths at that time were, so had encouraged me to speak to more people. Some did say that a Chartered Qualification might not be something I might be able to pursue from within their division, because of some of the requirements of the Qualification – that you had to do work that was more closely linked to what “Finance” people did, rather than to what “Commercial Due Dilligence” people did. This made sense!</p>

<p>So, they then introduced me to some of the Partners in the “Financial Due Dilligence” division. Unfortunately, the Partners there said I had just missed out on the deadline for that year’s intake, and that if I wanted to start with them, I would have to wait another year. After that, I got introduced to some Partners in other departments. That’s when, I think, I met a Partner from Australia, who said they still had some room for a few empty places in the company’s “Investment Management Group” division, in their Assurance deparment, and that they would be willing to bring me in.</p>

<p>So, that’s when I took up their offer, and moved divisions, from the company’s “The Strategy Group” division (in their Advisory department) to the company’s “Investment Management Group” division (in their Assurance department).</p>

<p>The work was a little different in the “Investment Management Group” division (less to do with doing commercial market research, but more business legal and accounting investigative, mathematical and financial in nature. In fact, some of the mathematical complexity of the work reminded me of some of problems I got to work on at some of the just-in-time factories I visited during my Engineering degree. My role also involved a lot more travel to different client offices, so I was developing a new skill set.</p>

<p>Apart from the vast amount of knowledge I picked up, amongst the things I did, practically I got to learn how to value different kinds of “Financial Investments”, using different kinds of “Financial Models”. The experience too of working for many different companies gave me a better first hand appreciation of some of the challenges and risks (e.g. financial client exposures, breach of bank covenants) that might be faced when running a business.</p>

<p>It was an exprience that made me realise that Finance is something that sits at the beating heart of any business, and is a very important area to understand and get to grips with. After 3 years, working in the “Investment Management Group”, I successfully got my Chartered Qualification.</p>

<p><strong>I’m so happy to hear that Sachin! I know from a lot of people that the CA can be a very challenging qualification to get. Any Chartered Qualification, in any industry, especially one that takes 3 years, is a challenge! It’s something that needs a lot of dedication, a lot of focus and commitment, not just because of all the tough exams you have to sit – but also because you have to work in a demanding full-time job at the same time! So, congratulations on persisting with that! So, I wonder, after you qualified, and got your Chartered Qualification, what did you decide to do next?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the day I qualified and got my CA, I went out and celebrated with friends, of course, who went through the same training as me. I remember going out and buying myself a very expensive bottle of Champagne - (a Dom Perignon, I distinctly remember)! That was a great feeling!</p>

<p>In terms of actual work, I wasn’t entirely sure about what I wanted to do next. Quite a few people in my peer group, moved across to another division or department, with the company. Some left the company to pursue their own thing. My bosses in “<strong>The Investment Management Group</strong>” were quite pleased with the progress I had been making, and work I was doing. I think they also saw me as a very valuable team member that was giving them good continuity of work to my then main client – “The Wellcome Trust” – the London based, Medical Research Charity.</p>

<p>Personally, I also didn’t feel like I needed to move anywhere else immediately. I had established a good relationship with the various people at my main client, “The Wellcome Trust”. I also felt like I was doing good work, and still learning new things, as I was able to further develop my management, supervisory, coaching and mentoring skills, as for example, other, less experienced members joined my team. So, I decided to stay, with my division for another 2 years – and ended up working with the “Investment Management Group”, in London, for a full 5 years!</p>

<p>It was a pretty amazing extra 2 years too! I continued working for my main client, “<strong>The Wellcome Trust</strong>”, doing finance type of work (e.g. in financial modelling, valuations, negotiations, assurance, advisory, etc.) - either doing myself, or checking the work of others - but I was also able to work for a variety of other companies too! For example, for an Engineering Construction Company (<strong>Balfour Beauty</strong>) – on a Renewable Energy Fund they were looking to set up; for the Pharmaceutical Company (<strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong>) to help their Business Assurance team with some year end audit checks; for two Commercial Real Estate Companies (<strong>Land Securities</strong>, and <strong>Deutsche Bank RREEF</strong>); And then for a short period of time, for the firms “Sustainability &amp; Climate Change Group” division – working on a project for the IMF (<strong>International Monetary Fund</strong>), to help them create a new Climate Investment Fund to invest in new Renewable Energy projects – something I was proud to be a part of… thinking about the work my Grandfather did in designing and building Hydroelectric Dams, in India.</p>

<p><strong>Well Sachin, it certainly sounds like you got involved in plenty of projects and areas, working for companies across quite a few sectors. When you were there, working towards both your Qualification AND for the company’s Clients, how was juggling that? What would you now say to other people, perhaps new graduates or other young professionals, who might be aspiring to follow a very similar path, early on in their career?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I would say, as with any path, there can be both peaks and troughs, and I found that to be the case with my experiences.</p>

<p>Before I started at PwC, some people would warn me of the sometimes very long hours I would have to work, both in the company’s  “Advisory” department, but also in the “Assurance” department in their “Investment Management Group” division. They also said that the CA, at a Professional Services firm, was also no easy thing to get! They warned me of how hard and challenging it would be!</p>

<p>Now, I will admit, the hours were long! That I can say! But I think, the hours were probably just as long in the company’s other divisions too. I also think that when you’re starting something new, whatever company or industry that may be in, and achieving a “high standard” is your goal, then when do you not have to put in some long hours?</p>

<p>Initially, when I started, I did sometimes find working as the most “junior” person in the team as quite frustrating. You can end up being given a lot of mundane work, and you might not get to participate in as many client meetings, as you perhaps might like to, compared to those more senior to you. But, again, I think, the same is probably true at a lot of places, and depends heavily on what knowledge and skills, experitise and experiences you already have, and what you can realistically bring to the table!</p>

<p>Overall, when I look back at those years, I did feel like I was able to learn a lot, both from the formal training I went through, but also some of the people I worked with – motivated, smart, very hard working people – some of whom I am still in quite close touch with today!</p>

<p>In these kinds of companies, it is true, you can end up working with people – managers, partners - who can be really difficult to deal with. But I think, it is important to not let that affect your work, or for you to be affected by that kind of environment!</p>

<p>One thing, I would say, that I did not like, was that I had a lot of outside interests and hobbies: Tennis, Cricket, wathcin Formula 1, Films &amp; Music, getting into Health &amp; Fitness, and Cooking, amongst others. I also wanted to spend more time socialising with friends, outside of work, and to visit more places, socially, in London.</p>

<p>But because of the long hours, I personally found these difficult to fit in. The volumes of work can be very high, and there are always deadlines to meet. And trying to do this, whilst doing all the extra work needed, for 3 years, to complete my C.A., wasn’t easy! It wasn’t impossible, but it was a lot of hours and a lot of hard work, and looking back I had to sacrifice quite a lot in terms of my social life and social activities, (e.g. when I worked across a lot of weekends -for 3 years – which was tough)!</p>

<p><em>What I would say to others that might be considering following a similar path?</em></p>

<p>I think it really depends on what you want from the experience, and how you think it will help with your long-term career plan. I think many people’s career plans do change and shift overtime – as their interests change and shift over time - it’s only natural!</p>

<p>I think what people should ask themselves is what avenues will open up or be available to them after they get enough of the kinds of experience they want, or level of standard in their work they are looking to achieve, before they decide to move on, however many years that might be - that’s of course if they don’t decide to stay where they are forever.</p>

<p>Understanding what experiences, knowledge and skills you get at each stage and how that fits into your Bigger Career Picture will definitely help you become more committed and convinced to any decisions you do end up making. This will help you to move forward with a stronger sense of purpose and conviction (even if the early stages - say first 2 years somewhere are very challening because everything is so new to you). And if you’re unsure, then get some advice beforehand - from friends, career coaches, mentors, potential sponsors, or other people close to you that you trust.</p>

<p>When I look at my own experiences: - towards the end of my University degree, after getting encouragement from family and friends to try something with a company that might give me a slightly different perspective into ‘<em>Business</em>’ from the “<em>Research &amp; Development</em>” experiences I had gained till then, I decided to start by working some years at a Professional Services company, to learn more and get some experience in areas such as <em>Management Consulting</em>, <em>Finance</em>, <em>Accounting</em>, and <em>Tax</em></p>

<p>The offer from PwC was a chance to work for a well-known, well-established company, one large enough that I would have the opportunity to work with people from a wide variety of backgrounds - e.g. different nationalities, different university degrees, different ethnicities, and so on - as we worked together to solve tough and challenging, what turned out to be financial and strategic business problems.</p>

<p>And in the 5- 6 years I was there, I felt I had achieved quite a lot:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I got an interesting mixture of experiences in from the company’s  “Assurance” and “Advisory” departments.</li>
  <li>I left with a Chartered Qualification, a C.A. – a well-respected, internationally well-recognised, business qualification, something I worked hard to get, and which gave me some of the skills (in Finance, Tax, and Accountancy) I knew I would need to have to successfull work in a business.</li>
  <li>I felt fortunate to have worked for a wide range of companies too (small, medium sized, and large; private and public; even FTSE 100 companies), across a lot of industries: (media &amp; entertainment, engineering, medical, charitable, educational, real estate, investment management, and so on.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t think I would have gotten the opportunity to work for such a range of companies and industries had I perhaps worked elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It felt too, from the department I mostly worked in, that I got a better appreciation of the different kinds of risks that might be faced when running a business (e.g. knowing what “Accounts Debtors” meant, and how important when trying to minimise your Client Exposures)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it has definitely helped me towards achieving my long term career plan – of “one day” being someone who can works effectively with other people to solve ‘<em>globally important and challenging problems; to support creative, talented, and innovative people, in the ‘</em>Media, Entertainment<em>”, and “</em>Technology &amp; Engineering*” sectors - as a Senior Business Leader‘</p>

<p>– It’s what I have over time discovered my passion to be!</p>

<p>But going back to answering the original question - <em>what I would say to others considering pursuing a similar path?</em>:</p>

<p>Well, in Professional Services, at least in the department I was in, the hours can be both long and intense. And in the early years (not months, but first 2 to 3 years), you will likely have to sacrifice quite a lot in terms of the other extra-curricular activities you might want to pursue. For me, the workloads definitely felt more than how I worked during my University Degree, from the teams and people I worked in and with.</p>

<p>That said, hard work (provided you take care of your health and mental well-being) usually does eventually pay off. You will definitely learn about Business (some functions), and you will definitely, if you decide to pursue something like a C.A. Qualification, get to work on solving some pretty “interesting” and “complex” mathematical problems, and learn more about what “Finance &amp; Accountancy” and “Tax” is. So, it is something that will definitely provide you with a very strong foundation to build on, whatever the next stages of you career.</p>

<p>This of course is just the first stage that I happened to choose, from the different opportunities that came to me at different moments in time, and encouragement I got from those around me.</p>

<p>Other people, in their own minds, might have a slightly different path in mind. Some people, for example, may already have in their minds a very strong sense of what their <strong><em>passion</em></strong> is, and what they want their “<strong><em>sector focus</em></strong>” to be, and consequently just work for a company in that <strong><em>sector</em></strong>, maybe the by pursuing a CIMA, (a different type of Finance &amp; Accounting qualitication). Then, once they are in that sector, they know they want to be strongly <em>affiliated with</em> I guess then decide on what they want their “<strong><em>role focus</em></strong>” to be. After that they will then try to start creating the right opportunities for themselves.</p>

<h2 id="business-school---mba">Business School - MBA</h2>

<p><strong>Thank you for sharing that Sachin! I’m sure some of our readers will really appreciate you taking the time to share your experiences in this way – I personally, don’t think very many people, from the outset, ever really figure out their entire career path out completely - sector or role focus, or ever try to be too savvy about following a career path in exactly the way they might have originally imagined. But everyone eventually does find their own path, and true compass.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So, tell me more. As you were working at PwC, why after 6 years did you decide to leave your role, to pursue your MBA?</strong></p>

<p>Really, the honest answer is that I just saw it as another challenge. Getting a Chartered Qualification was a challenge, I found my work, initially, in PwC’s “Advisory” department also quite challenging. Then the work in their “Assurance” department, in their “Investment Management Group” division. After working there for about 5 years, I was just looking for a change. And I saw the MBA as another challenge – and a good opportunity to strengthen some skills and get some new experiences.</p>

<p>Reflecting on all the skills I have gained upto that point, I saw that my Masters in Engineering degree had honed my quantitative and analytical skills, and given me a better understanding of operations management and manufacturing, and cultivated an interest too in Technology. I then saw that my experiences at PwC had given me a very good grounding and understanding of Finance &amp; Accounting and Tax, and gradually too, better appreciation of some of the risks involved in running a business, from a financial and in part, strategic perspective (from my early days in the company’s Advisory department).</p>

<p>Next, from my career, I was just looking to broaden my horizons. One thing I wanted was to get a better exposure to International Commerce, but then also get some experience to business functions that were outside the Finance Function (where I had spent most of my time at PwC): such as those in Marketing, Human Resource Management, Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship, Business Strategy, and areas in Finance that I had previously not had that much exposure to, such as: Venture Capital and Private Equity, Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Corporate Recovery &amp; Turnaround.</p>

<p>With so many of those close to me in my life, like my Dad and Uncle, cousins, other close friends and relatives having also done an MBA at some point in their career, its something I had strongly aspired to do. At age 30, with 6.5 years of work experience (since my Master’s degree, or 7.5, if you include my gap year), I thought why not - 7.5 years into what will likely be a 42.5 year career, with another full 35 years to go, I thought it just might be a good time to pursue one!</p>

<p>It would be a great opportunity to increase the size and strength of my business network, and more importantly, chance to get to meet and work with people from very different industries, and professional backgrounds to my own.</p>

<p>At Manchester Business School, where I did my 2 year full-time MBA, I think my class alone had 105 people from over 33 different nationalities, very many of whom had worked in very different industries to mine - ranging from The Royal Air Force, The National Health Service, Human Resourcing, Marketing &amp; Advertising, Law, Management Consultancy, Supply Chain &amp; Logistics, Information Technology, Manufacturing Engineering, Media, Print &amp; Publishing, Oil &amp; Gas, Transportation &amp; Airlines, Private Wealth Management, and Entrepreneurship – pretty much every industry under the sun!</p>

<p>I also felt it would give me some time to reflect on my career achievements to date, and think about what work I might want to do after my MBA, which, if I’m honest, I found quite difficult to find the time to do, when I was in my full-time job at PwC.</p>

<p>I had some idea of the industry I wanted to work in, or let’s say be closely affiliated with – these were the “Engineering and Technology”, and “Media &amp; Entertainment” sectors.</p>

<p>So, I felt I was clear, in my mind, on my “sector-focus”, but I was a little unclear on my “role focus” and the kind of roles I might want to work in next. So, that was another thing that I felt doing my MBA would help me clarify.</p>

<p>So, with all these benefits in mind (being able to get a better exposure to International Commerce; the new knowledge and experiences I would get from working across a range of business functions; the opportunity I would get to meet and learn from new people; the time I would get to reflect on my career achievements to date; and the time I would get to think about the kind of role I felt I might enjoy working in next),…I decided to leave the role I had at PwC, and start a 22-month full-time MBA programme at Manchester Business School, in the U.K.</p>

<p>The MBA programme itself is a very practical, and project-oriented programme, that involves an incredible amount of teamwork, particularly when working across its range of commercial projects, both here in the UK, and Internationally. And in terms of exploring new, and potentially exciting future roles, it gave me the chance to learn more about roles such as those in: general management, marketing finance, commercial finance, business development, business strategy, financial planning, strategic planning, venture capital, and roles in technology that I felt were new and rapidly emerging, that I felt would be really useful future skills to have!</p>

<p><strong>That’s great to hear again Sachin! So, you were looking for a new challenge! You wanted to get a better exposure to international commerce, widen your knowledge and experience of business, across its different functions, meet new people, grow your business network, get some time to reflect about the past, as well as some time to think about what roles you could work in, in the future - with renewed commitment, confidence, and conviction!</strong></p>

<p><strong>So, you left your first major employer after University, PwC, to go take part in an International Business School programme with one of Europe’s leading Business Schools, Manchester Business School. Now, having gone through a 2-year full time programme, how do you feel? What do you think those 22 months of experience gave you?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I can very confidently say that it gave me a better first-hand exposure to International Commerce, and wider knowledge of Business, across all its functions, from: Marketing, Human Resourcing, Finance, Business Strategy, and Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>And this was not just through the classroom teachings, though that was obviously important, as what I had learnt from the classroom were the findings of vast amounts of research carried out by the Business School’s Professors and Academics from studying 100s of companies, rather than just one case study.</p>

<p>But I learnt a lot too from the various Commercial Business Projects I had participated in.</p>

<p>For example, I remember working on quite a range of different (Business) projects: Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developing a “<strong><em>Marketing Plan &amp; Campaign</em></strong>”, for a local chain of nurseries in central Manchester – called “Big Life Nurseries” - to try and raise their brand awareness across the different suburbs and local communities in Mannchester, to try and increase the demand for Nursery services from new customer groups.</li>
  <li>Helping a “<strong><em>National Travel &amp; Hospitality company</em></strong>” - “Netflights” - (now part of the DNATA group) - learn more about the “Sharing Economy” - and some of the challenges the company might face from new entrants into the sector, such as AirBnB - that was fast capturing market share by being able to provide more authentic holiday stay experience over the traditional providers.</li>
  <li>Writing a “<strong><em>Business Plan</em></strong>” for a business idea we felt could help retailers (i) save money in the cost of returned goods, and (ii) better target higher value, higher lifetime customers - by creating a “unique customer return profile database” whose services could be sold to several retailers. Then later, participating in presenting and pitching our business plan to a real life Venture Capitalist.</li>
  <li>Working on an “<strong><em>International Business Project</em></strong>” for a multi-national retailer (across the Middle East), that wanted advice on how it could better manage its “Facilities Management” spend and activities – so it could try and achieve both “cost savings”, and increase “the quality” of its relationships with existing suppliers.</li>
  <li>Other projects I remember working on included, two “<strong><em>Advanced Strategic Management projects</em></strong>”: on the Automotive Engineering company, BMW; and then Media &amp; Entertainment company, Walt Disney; and then one “<strong><em>Corporate Recovery &amp; Turnaround</em></strong>” project on the Video Games and Video Games Console company, The Nintendo company.</li>
</ul>

<p>And asides from the Commercial Business Projects, I got a lot of opportunity too for extra-curricular development - which had instilled in me a much stronger, much healthier attitude, to push myself to try out new things.</p>

<p>These included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Signing up to become a member of the business school’s “<strong><em>Banking &amp; Finance</em></strong>” society. Doing that gave me the opportunity to mentor many of those in my class who did not have much previous experience in but wanted to learn more about <strong><em>Finance &amp; Accounting</em></strong> (an area I had gotten quite a lot of exposure to, before my MBA, at PwC). So, I was able to spend some time coaching my MBA Group some of the key principles in <strong><em>Finance &amp; Accounting</em></strong>, but also take more of a leading role in the group assignments we did, for example in our <strong><em>Economics</em></strong>, <strong><em>Venture Capital</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Corporate Finance</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions</em></strong> classes and projects.</li>
  <li>Then, signing up to become a member of the business school’s “<strong><em>Consulting Club</em></strong>”, to help many of my classmates who wanted to get summer internships or full-time offers with Management Consulting companies, by helping them practice through different kinds of “consulting case studies” ahead of any interviews - which I already had some earlier experience in, before I started working at PwC in their “Strategy Group” division.</li>
  <li>Then, participating in a “<strong><em>European Private Equity Case Competition</em></strong>”, in an inter-MBA business school case competition that was held in Amsterdam, where in a small team representing the Business School, I was able to help advise a small Dutch Investment Fund on the different ways it could structure a new investment into a Solar Energy Power Project, in South Africa.</li>
  <li>Then, playing in my Business School’s “<strong><em>Table Tennis</em></strong>” team, and competing in the Annual European Sports Tournament, MBAT, that was held in France - a sports tournament attended by all the other leading business schools across Europe.</li>
  <li>And then finally, in whatever time I had left, helping organise and participate in different <strong><em>social events</em></strong> and <strong><em>evenings</em></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, for me, there were just so many strands of <strong><em>personal development</em></strong>, <strong><em>communication</em></strong>, and <strong><em>leadership</em></strong>, that I got from doing my MBA, just by being in an environment, and getting to work with a lot of smart and motivated people, every day, for two years, it was just that “<strong><em>hive of activity</em></strong>”, working with and for Senior Business Leaders across different Industries, together with Senior Academic Professors - that was one of my biggest takeaways from my MBA.</p>

<p>With these experiences, I was also obviously able to develop and learn new skills. I don’t think it is possible to list all of them, right here, right now, but here are a few that I felt I was able to develop:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My Management and Leadership skills of teams and with colleagues.</li>
  <li>My Problem Solving, Reasoning, and Creativity skills</li>
  <li>My International Outlook of the world, Team Orientation, and ability to work in International Teams</li>
  <li>My ability to share my experiences and express my ideas to other groups of people, both written, verbally, or through presentations</li>
  <li>My Client Relationship Management skills</li>
  <li>My Financial and Budgetary responsibility skills</li>
  <li>My Decision-Making skills</li>
  <li>My Contributory skills to Business Strategy</li>
  <li>My Analytical, Numeracy, and Negotiation skills</li>
  <li>My ability to Generate New Ideas.</li>
  <li>My ability to work with some very bright, very motivated, and enthusiastic people, each with a strong sense of personal values, community involvement, and work integrity</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes, I think, other people in their careers, think that they are already very successful, or that they are already very experienced, or already very well-educated, or may feel like they have already learnt a lot, and so will just stay where there are. That may be certainly be true! And that’s fine, there is nothing wrong with that! If it was your cup of team, you could end up being a Partner of Tax at a Professional Services firm – if that is something you wanted to do, and believed would always get you up in the morning, something you were so truly passionate about, that you would continue to keep doing, and have the guts and conviction to pursue that, over the long term, for the rest of your career.</p>

<p>From my perspective, I think that by doing a 2 year MBA (compared to something else), you are just as likely to learn as much, but this time from more people, those with a much greater <strong><em>perspective</em></strong> and <strong><em>diversity</em></strong> of experiences that you have – who are all there, because they want to help each other - both as citizens of society and leaders of the business world!</p>

<p><strong>Well it sounds like you had an incredible time Sachin! You did and learnt a wide variety of new things - and as you say, not just from your classroom professors, and case studies, but also from the commercial business projects you were able to take part in, the colleagues you got to work with, and all the extracurricular activities you were able to get involved with.</strong></p>

<p><strong>So, as you approached the end of the programme, and as the time came to start thinking about what you might want to do next, what different pathways or roles did you start to consider? I imagine you must have been thinking about quite a few options, given all the new skills, knowledge, and materials you must have built-up and developed over those two years.</strong></p>

<p>Yes, that’s right. I had been considering a few different pathways or roles. Specifically, roles in: general management, commercial finance, marketing finance, financial planning, strategic planning, business development, business strategy, but also technology roles, in areas that I felt were new and rapidly emerging.</p>

<p>After all that experience, I just wanted to be able do something where I could use what I had learnt in “Technology, Engineering, and Operations” Management from my Engineering Degree; what I had learnt about in “Finance &amp; Accountancy” and “Tax” when I had worked at PwC; and then the broad range of knowledge, and skills I had built-up over my MBA.</p>

<p>I knew the two sectors that interested me the most were the “<strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>”, or “<strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong>” sectors – so I was looking for companies that did creative things in these two sectors.</p>

<h2 id="freelancing---data--technology">Freelancing - Data &amp; Technology</h2>

<p><strong>So, after your MBA, from the pathways and roles you were considering, I see, eventually, you ended up starting your own company - providing “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Data Analytics” solutions. Are you able to tell us a little bit more about how you ended up going down this path?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, well, both during and immediately after my MBA, I had been considering different roles, as I said, in: general management, commercial finance, marketing finance, financial planning, strategic planning, business development, and business strategy, and new and rapidly emerging areas in technology.</p>

<p>For me, nothing much was biting in the market. In May 2016, UK economy and many UK businesses were affected badly by Brexit - so that didn’t help with trying to find paid work, particularly for those at the MBA level. And I was quite selective too, as I already knew the two sectors that I wanted to work in.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, over this time as I was directly applying to companies, I had also started to learn more about this area called: “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>” - it was a new area for me!</p>

<p>Towards the end of my MBA, over our 3-month International Business Project, I had been working in the Middle East for a multi-national retailer out there. And that was the first time I had learnt about this new “<strong><em>Advanced Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>” tool, called “<em>Tableau</em>” - something that had been developed by some Computer Science Researchers at Stanford University.</p>

<p>I had never really heard about “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>” before. But after investing some time to learn more about it, and then using it successfully on that project in the Middle East to provide the client with new insights from the data we had collected, the retailer’s Group CFO, on seeing our final written report and presentation, was really impressed! He too had never seen or heard about such tools, and how they could be used, so gave me and my team some really incredible feedback!</p>

<p>So, given how well that project had gone, I got a lot of encouragement from relatives, friends, and MBA work colleagues, to further explore and learn more about the area.</p>

<p>I was also personally really quite curious!</p>

<p>I saw it as a high growth area - something that a lot of companies in the future would need people with well-developed skills and expertise in. I knew too that with significant advances being made in adjacent fields such as “<strong><em>Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence</em></strong>” – that demand for modern data analytics tools, to help companies keep pace with their own growing data needs, would also only increase!</p>

<p>So, after realising this, and after the encouragement I got, after my MBA, my pathways became: general management, commercial finance, marketing finance, financial planning, strategic planning, business development, business strategy, but also, because of this newly founded fascination with, “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>”.</p>

<p>After my MBA, I was at home a lot (at my Parent’s house), so decided instead of being dictated by the whims and fancies of companies that I had been trying to find paid work at, in the U.K., I did three things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I set up my own company, which was a learning experience in itself - something where my PwC skills came in handy!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also spent quite some time too in creating my own website to establish an online presence.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I invested a lot of personal time, to learn and sharpen my skills in “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>”, and the different Business Intelligence softwares I knew about in the market at the time, such as: “<em>Tableau</em>” and “<em>Power BI</em>”, and software languages like DAX, and M-code, needed to create and develop solutions with them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I also took some steps too, to develop my own <strong><em>Data Management</em></strong> and <strong><em>Data Reporting</em></strong> skills, by reading through relevant books and blog articles that I found on the topic, (for example, “<strong><em>The Definitive Guide to DAX</em></strong>” by Marco Russo and Alberto Ferrari, taught me about some of the fundamental principles of database design; Then the book, “<strong><em>‘M’ is for Data Monkey</em></strong>” by Ken Plus, taught me about different ETL techniques that can be used to “extract”, “clean”, “transform”, and “load” data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some other extra time I had, I thought about learning more about “<strong><em>Data Science &amp; Machine Learning</em></strong>”, but also “<strong><em>Artificial Intelligence</em></strong>”, which I though might also be a useful future skill to have. So I read through this book called “<strong><em>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</em></strong>” by Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani, to learn more about Machine Learning (just basic things such as what test data, training data, classification algorithms, and regression algorithms, etc. were). Then also learning more about the software language ‘R’ that was used to solve Machine Learning kind of problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In parallel with the above I started trying to connect with people, Senior Business People, where I could start to apply and develop these skills, focusing on customers and companies in the  “<strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>”, or “<strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong>” sectors - any team, anywhere in the world, that needed or might be interested in employing “<strong><em>Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics</em></strong>” solutions to solving their current business problems. But it is hard work to find customers!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So this is all how it kind of started.</p>

<h2 id="industry---jaguar-land-rover">Industry - Jaguar Land Rover</h2>

<p><strong>Thanks for explaining that transition Sachin, that was very clear! So, after you had done all the hard work of researching and learning more about “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” and developing your skills in that area, how did you go about trying to find customers? How did you find that? Did you see an increase in demand from companies for people with such skills?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I did. An increase in both awareness, interest, demand and actions they were taking. Finding customers, initially, I would say was definitely quite challenging. My networks with people, in the field, in the two sectors I wanted to work in, weren’t so strong, especially given the economic situation at the time (Brexit)</p>

<p>Then one day, after having sent an application to them, I remember talking to the Head of the Product Finance department at Jaguar Land Rover. He was trying to manage a team that were responsible for recording and reporting on the cost (actual cost standard cost, etc.), but also location, and condition of cars still owned by Jaguar Land Rover across the U.K. (those cars that had been made by the company and its Engineers, but which hadn’t yet been sold, and were still part the company’s inventory.)</p>

<p>His team had been having problems with getting and recording some information from the company’s own internal manufacturing, fleet management, and finance &amp; accounting systems - which had been causing some delays in reporting to the company’s stakeholders: the Group CFO and his immediate team, the company’s parent company, The Tata Group, and then to the company’s external Auditors, Deloitte - who had a small team in their office at the time, to do their usual Audit checks.</p>

<p>As I didn’t have much else on, that was giving me a paid income, they had invited me to work for them for 3 months starting for about a month and a half before their financial year-end. So, I had accepted their invitation. When I started, the company’s financial year-end was also only a month away, and they were under a lot of pressure to deliver this information to meet several internal deadlines, so when I started, I had to hit the ground running.</p>

<p>My own interpretation of the situation, when I started was that some of department’s processes were not working as well as they could have been, some didn’t even work at all. Some of the documentation they had too wasn’t all that good – much of it, either just completely absent, some it a few years (e.g. 3-4 years) out of date.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, to add to some of the difficulties they were already having, the handover I had from the earlier person - wasn’t all that neat either. And the relationships between some of the team members in the company’s Product Finance team and with the company’s external Auditors was not that great (In fact, I think the following year, they had decided to change their external Auditors from Deloitte, to KPMG).</p>

<p>So, when I started, I just took the steps to try and sort out the situation there, in ways I best knew how. That, initially, took me the good part of a whole month. Then, once things had settled down, I could focus on introducing my team to things such as “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics”, and sell the idea of using “Tableau”, to help better interpret and analyse the data that being generated and shared across with the rest of the department. So, that gave me two further months of work. I guess you could say that the work experience I got with Jaguar Land Rover, I got my first breakthrough, in that, after my MBA, they were my first main paying customer!</p>

<p>Then, after working at JLR, I started to look for my next customer, to try and basically sustain an income, with my next potential customer.</p>

<p>A few months after I had finished working at Jaguar Land Rover, in the December 2007, I then got a call from the Group CFO of the multi-national retailer, in the Middle East, I had worked for at the end of my MBA. Over the phone, he asked me whether I would be interested in doing some “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” work for them, back at their offices in Dubai for a few weeks. As I wasn’t working with any customers here in the UK, and was interested in learning more about “Power BI”, (at this point I only knew about “Tableau”), I accepted his invitation, and flew out to the Middle East to work with one of the Heads of their company’s “In-House Procurement” department.</p>

<p>Then, after successfully delivering what they wanted for their “In-House Procurement” team, because of the relationships he had with people in other companies (mostly CEOs and CFOs in other multi-national retail companies, across the Middle East), he then introduced me to other people he thought might also need some help with employing the skills I had been developing. So, when I was out there, I was able to work for a few more companies – in this case, retailers such as: “Majid Al Futtaim”, “Carrefour”, and, then also a medium-sized, but also multi-national printing-packaging company. And so that’s when I was able to get, what you might say, my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th customers.</p>

<p>I was quite a nice short spell. Being in the same place (the Middle East), for a few weeks, working for such a close cluster of companies. It was something that I actually really enjoyed. Outside work, I got to travel abroad for a few weeks, meet new people, and visit some of the region’s local tourist sights and attractions. I was able to learn a bit more too about the culture and history of cities like Abu Dhabi and Dubai, as I continued to develop and further advance my skills in area of: “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics”.</p>

<p>From the extra experience I got from working there, I guess it raised my own profile and awareness in the market, and helped to establish greater trust and credibility in the kind of work I was doing.</p>

<p>In fact, I should say that before I started working at Jaguar Land Rover in February 2017, that in December 2016 and January 2017, I was also able to visit a medium-sized District Eye Hospital, in Northern India, as they needed someone who could integrate “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” tools into their current systems - to improve the way they reported on the performance of their different Hospital Units – so they could see more clearly which Hospital units were growing, which units were in need of further investment etc. I had worked for them for a few weeks.</p>

<p>But going back to your original question, how did I find, finding new customers? Well, initially, quite challenging. It wasn’t easy, that’s something I kept telling myself. But gradually, through the people I knew, and relationships I had developed and cultivated, I got one or two lucky breakthroughs, intially with JLR in the UK, and then with a few Retailers across in the Middle East.</p>

<p><strong>Well, it sounds like, although you had struggled somewhat initially to find new customers, given you were still developing your skills in this area, and still trying to grow your networks – you eventually got one or two lucky breakthroughs: initially, at Jaguar Land Rover, in the UK, to help them overcome some internal data reporting issues; then later, at a collection of retailers, in the Middle East, on some of the data projects they needed your help with; and then also, I should not forget, a District Eye Hospital, in Northern India, to help them implement a better reporting solution across their Hospital.</strong></p>

<h2 id="industry---wpp">Industry - WPP</h2>

<p><strong>What about back here, in the United Kingdom? Can you tell us a little about that? How did finding customers here, in the UK, go, after Jaguar Land Rover?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I would say that things here were somewhat slow to begin with. For example, after working for Jaguar Land Rover, in their Product Finance Department, I had experienced quite a quiet patch. I had tried looking for new customers through the usual routes. For example, (i) online, on the internet, applying directly to roles that had been advertised through company websites and (ii) by looking at what vacancies recruitment agencies that helped people find work, had posted on their websites, and applying to and calling them.</p>

<p>I tried that for some time, but I wasn’t really making any meaningful progress. I would hit the usual barriers: a lot of unanswered calls and emails. When that started happening, it started to leave me with the impression that maybe there was no interest from companies for people with these kinds of skills. But I didn’t believe it, as there were still job that were being advertised asking for this kind of work.</p>

<p>So, I remained tenacious and persevered! I started exploring “more unorthodox” routes - I decided to send out an “offer of assistance” letter, to all the CEOs and all the CFOs of all the companies where, I thought there might be a genuine interest in this kind of work, to the companies I was interested in working for. I knew, abroad at least, that there was an interest with a lot of growing demand!</p>

<p>I must have sent 23 “offer of assistance” letters to about 23 different companies, including: Virgin, Sky, Pinewood, Warner Bros, Universal, Paramount, and Apple amongst those in the “Media &amp; Entertainment” sector. Then Sony, Honda, Toyota, Panasonic, Canon, BMW, Nissan, Dyson, Lamborghini, McLaren, Phillips, and Bose, amongst those in the “Engineering &amp; Technology” sector, as well as few smaller businesses close to where I lived, in my parent’s home town.</p>

<p>For some reason, and I don’t know why, I got <strong>one</strong> reply only, and that was from the Marketing &amp; Advertising company, WPP. My letter had somehow found its way to the Head of Human Resourcing of EMEA, who had forwarded my CV to various CEOs and CFOs across the company. That is when the U.K CFO of one of their digital CRM and E-commerce agencies, Wunderman Thompson, had seen my CV, and wanted to meet with me to learn more about my background, the skills I had developed, kind of work I had been doing recently with the Retailers in the Middle East.</p>

<p>When I did some online web research to learn more about what Wunderman Thompson did, I didn’t mind what the agency did so much. Even though they were not what I might traditionally consider as a “Media &amp; Technology” agency - like a Film or VFX company, I saw a lot of overlap between what the “Marketing &amp; Advertising” and “Media &amp; Entertainment” sectors did, in terms of “Multi-Media”, “Video-Making”, and “Creativity”, and so on. So, the work that the company did appealed to me!</p>

<p>So, the CFO called me to his offices. We had a good discussion, he talked about what he was looking to do, and the kind of reports he needed help with producing, and I then talked about my experiences, and the kind of work I had recently been doing. There was a strong mutual synergy!</p>

<p>Then a day or two later, I made another day trip to London, which is when I got to meet with one of the agency’s Managing Director’s, and we got talking. And it wasn’t long after that, they had invited me officially to come over to work for them at their main offices in Greater House London, near Mornington Crescent, initially on a 3-month contract.</p>

<p><strong>That’s really great Sachin! So, after working for some retailers, in the Middle East, you must have been delighted to have eventually secured some work back here in the UK! Obviously, the HR person you connected with, at WPP, when she saw your initial ‘offer of assistance’ letter and CV, and then later, the other people you met, they must have had a huge belief in your ability! How important do you think that is - the people and relationship aspect? – that ability to connect with people - those you gradually get to know obviously? How important do you think that is compared to some of the more formal degrees, and formal qualifications you may have worked towards and acquired over your career so far?</strong></p>

<p>I think it’s hard to differentiate between the two. Every moment is an opportunity to do something right, and to get some experience, and then learn from those experiences.</p>

<p>I’m sure the opportunity to work at WPP wouldn’t have come about, if I hadn’t had all the experiences, degrees, and qualifications I had gained up to that point. They probably liked the cross-functional experiences I had gotten from my MBA, and then some of the Finance &amp; Accountancy CA experiences I had gotten from PwC. Without that, I don’t think the meeting at WPP would have happened.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is, and it has probably become even stronger since – (working where I have, with the various people I have, over the years), – is that a strong appreciation of technology, followed by some formal training in finance, and accounting, followed by a broad and challenging business programme, like an MBA, if properly applied, are three of the best preparations you can have for a career in the commercial and business world.</p>

<p>I think many companies in the business world today, rely and operate very heavily on technology, and on the idea of having to follow some very black and white rules. But there are some situations, where it is just unrealistic to follow very black and white rules - and always have to stick to them. In these situations, you just need to know where the grey areas are, and where the red lines are, and how far you can push things!</p>

<p>It is ok to be comfortable in the grey areas, if you know where those are. You just have to be aware to not cross those red lines! But, if you know where those grey areas are, and have that ability to see things in a different way, that is where you can explore new commercial opportunities - these are the real opportunities, that usually lie, at the very margins.</p>

<p>At Wunderman, when I started, I recognised that I could really bring something extra by exploring those areas, where perhaps some of their existing people were reluctant to go, or didn’t quite understand the nuances of, or didn’t have the skills to apply relatively new technologies in new and different ways.</p>

<p>I think I was only able to do what I did, very successfully, at Wunderman, because of the degrees, qualifications, experiences, and interests, I had built up over my past life and career: during and before I did my MBA; during and before I worked at PwC; during and before I read Engineering at University; and when I went to Primary and Secondary School.</p>

<p>But then, I also think that asides from the degrees, qualifications and earlier experiences, that a lot must have also been due to how they saw me as a person and individual. I think the people I had met, and worked with at WPP, the CFO, MD, CTalentO, etc., they had identified in me someone they felt could fit well within the Wunderman agency, and WPP Group - that it would be a place where I would be welcomed, and could just get down to my work, and really thrive and flourish!</p>

<p>Personality would have been an important consideration. In that sense, you are always reliant on that in any job situation. In the interviews, the people I met were probably quite impressed by what I had to say, and obviously, they thought, that I would do well in the work they gave me.</p>

<p>I also think that much of the decision to hire me was probably down to the situation that WPP, and the Marketing &amp; Advertising Industry, more generally, was facing at the time - strong pressures from the Technology Industry – from companies such as Facebook, and Google.</p>

<p>Though the marketing spend and budgets of companies has not been falling (spend as a percentage of total revenue has remained the same for many companies for quite a few years) – where companies have been spending their marketing spend, has been changing quite rapidly, shifting more and more towards online channels of ad spend (such as programmatic advertising), rather than on the traditional offline channels (such as TV, or Print Magazines), which WPPs existing agency network model had been slow to adapt to.</p>

<p>In WPP’s case, there had been a big change in the company’s leadership, with the departure of Martin Sorrel, under quite controversial circumstances, and then appointment of Mark Read. Mark had actually been the CEO of Wunderman, the agency I was invited to work at, before moving on to his new role, as Group CEO of the WPP Group.</p>

<p>The company had gone through several changes when I was there: it decided to restate its brand identity, vision and values. Given how both complex and complicated the business had become, globally, for its customers, they were taking steps to further simplify the business. For example, they decided to merge J. Walter Thompson, the world’s then oldest ad agency, with Wunderman, their digital e-commerce agency to create a new agency called Wunderman Thompson. I read in the news somewhere too that they had merged VML, their digital advertising agency, with Young &amp; Rubicam, another one of their advertising agencies. As further changes, they had also started co-locating agencies into the same Campus Buildings in some of their European Offices.</p>

<p>So, going back to your original question, the opportunity to work for them, I would say came about because of a combination of factors - an “alignment of the stars and planets!” - so to speak, if you believe in all that good Karma kind of stuff!</p>

<p>It came down to: my earlier degrees, qualifications, and experiences; how they saw me as a person; how they felt I might fit within the culture of a “Marketing &amp; Advertising” company, such as WPP; then also, because of what was actually happening in the company and industry at the time, they needed someone with a very specific set of skills - who could pick up the work they wanted to do, very quickly.</p>

<p>Of course, there was also some luck in it too! My CV actually being read by the right person, at the right time, and then, the initiative that was taken by their CFO and MD of Wunderman Thompson to invite, meet and talk to me in the first place!</p>

<p><strong>That sounds really interesting Sachin – so quite a multitude of different factors led to the appointment at WPP, but, I guess, it all started with you trying a slightly different, “unorthodox approach”, of sending out direct “offer of assistance” letters to some very Senior Business People at various companies, across the “Engineering &amp; Technology”, and “Media &amp; Entertainment” sectors in the UK - when before you had initially tried other routes and channels that were just not working for you! Before you started, did you know much about WPP? What was it like working for them? How long did you work there for?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the “Marketing &amp; Advertising” wasn’t an industry I knew “as well” as the “Engineering &amp; Technology”, or “Media &amp; Entertainment” sectors. I probably wasn’t going to work / meet with people who worked in a Special FX studio, or bump into Film Directors at WPP, and it wasn’t going to be quite like an MIT Media Lab, or experimental Google / Alphabet labs kind of a place. But I did know that it was quite a well-known company in the “Marketing &amp; Advertising” industry – both here in the U.K., and Internationally – alongside other companies industry names, such as, Dentsu, in Japan, Publicis, in France, and Omnicom, in the United States.</p>

<p><em>How was it like working there?</em></p>

<p>Well, I had a really good time. My immediate team were wonderful, very warm and welcoming, very multi-cultural, very international, and I grew to admire the culture of the agency at Wunderman. That’s one thing I thought they did very well at Wunderman.</p>

<p>Thinking about my team alone and where the people were from: there was one person of South African descent, one person of Australian descent, two of British descent, one of Pakistani descent, two of Indian descent (if you include me), and another of Nigerian descent. Then in the team that sat to my right of my team, there was one person from Brazil, two from Spain, one from India, one from Zambia, one from Finland, one from Hungary, one from France, another from Russia, and two or three people from Italy. So, it was very diverse!</p>

<p>WPP’s Wunderman agency was one of the first places I had worked at, where, after a very long time, I felt I could really be myself. It was very different to the very formal experiences I had at PwC. At WPP, you didn’t always have to show yourself to be an overly formal “corporate” citizen, and wear a buttoned-up suit, jacket and tie, every day, all the time. I learnt that that kind of thing doesn’t quite work in the Marketing &amp; Advertising industry – though I’ll admit, not having to wear a suit and tie every day did take some getting used to!</p>

<p>The Agency’s authenticity was also something I really liked. In organisations where there is that authenticity, you give yourself a much better chance of just being able to be yourself and do well! And, it felt great, after a very long time to have a permanent desk! Having a permanent desk gets more and important as you get older - so that was something else I enjoyed, not having to “hot desk”!</p>

<p>The work itself was also quite tough and challenging. I constantly felt like I was being pushed by my peers outside of my comfort zone. I was encouraged too, to give my own suggestions and contribute my own ideas to some of the data reporting problems they needed help with. This is something I am very grateful to my immediate team for allowing me to do.</p>

<p>Then, after working with the UK CFO, and in his team for 3 months, the European MD who also interviewed me, asked me if I wanted to do similar kind of work for their Global CFO, and team in Los Angeles. I saw it as a great opportunity to further apply my “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” skills to new problems, and again thought why not – it would open me up to new learning and development opportunities.</p>

<p>And so, that’s when I got to start working with some of their colleagues in their Los Angeles office (but eventually only remotely from here in London). The MD was so impressed with me and the work I was doing, that he increased my daily pay rate, to what he felt was a much fairer rate for the quality of work I was doing So, that made me feel really good, especially as it was something he did, without me ever asking! I’ll never forget that!</p>

<p>If you want to look and think about things in terms of size: though Wunderman was not as big as some of the companies I had worked at before (in terms of no. of staff, and size of revenue), as say those in “The Investment Management Group” division, in the “Assurance” department, at PwC, or at some of the “Retail” companies I had worked for in the Middle East, or even “Jaguar Land Rover”, here in the UK, they (Wunderman Thompson) are still no small agency! They employ now 10,000 to 12,000 people, and have a wide global footprint, with a well-connected network of international offices (Double that, if you consider the merger later with JWT). So, I definitely felt like I was able to make some very important contributions.</p>

<p>Then, after working for the Global Commercial team at Wunderman, my work at WPP continued. They asked me to stay working for them, for another 10 to 11 months, where I eventually ended up working for 3 to 4 other agencies across the Group!</p>

<p><strong>Well, Sachin, I can definitely tell you got a lot of enjoyment working WPP! Not many people, I imagine, would be able to say that they got to work for 4 to 5 different agencies, at the same company, within the space of just 12 months. What do you think made you different in the eyes of the people around you, the MDs, CFOs, CTalentOs, and CEOs you worked with?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I think the fact that I got to work several agencies, was partly to do with the fact that I was working as a freelancer, so they had the freedom to move me around from project to project more easily, to do the kind of things they felt could be further improved. And because I really liked what I was doing, and the different problems I was being asked to work on, I gradually became better, and better. And the people around me started to really appreciate my work.</p>

<p>I think also the MD I had been working with, saw in me, various things he felt I could bring to other agencies across the WPP Group. For example, the understanding I had gained in “<strong><em>Engineering &amp; Technology</em></strong>” from University; the grounding I had gained in “<strong><em>Finance &amp; Accountancy</em></strong>” at PwC; the broader “<strong><em>Business Functional</em></strong>” experiences I had gained from my MBA, to then also, the more recent <strong><em>Entrepreneurial</em></strong>” experiences I had gained from running my own company as a freelancer learning about “<strong><em>BI &amp; Data</em></strong>” – along with the continued interest I maintained in the “<strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong>” sector. I think he saw ALL of that as a really unique and powerful combination.</p>

<p>After I had finished working for Wunderman’s Global Finance Team, he then asked whether I wanted to do some work for Wunderman’s Human Resourcing department, as they needed some help with some problems the HR department were having. I saw it as an opportunity to solve more problems, but this time in a different business function. I also felt it would allow me to apply some of the things I had learnt from the “Human Resource Management” classes I took on my MBA.</p>

<p>So, I said “Yes”. That gave me the opportunity to work in a very different business function - Wunderman’s UK Human Resourcing department, for a month or two - working with two or three of their Chief Talent Officers, to help that department build up some new HR capabilities.</p>

<p>Then, after helping out there, the same MD asked me whether I could help with a project the company wanted to start working on, at their agency, “Geometry” - a new initiative to create and implement a new Global Budgeting tool. They were looking for someone with my kind of skills and background, but also someone who had worked for some months within the WPP Group.</p>

<p>I saw no reason not to say “Yes”, and so, started working for their agency “Geometry”. In fact, it was on that project that I also got to work with a person, who had previously been an MD of Geometry, but after that project, later went on to become the “Global Head of Data and A.I.” at the WPP Group.</p>

<p>Then, after successfully completing this project at Geometry, I was invited back by the same MD at Wunderman, to work for the Wunderman EMEA Finance team, for their European CFO, to help build-out and improve certain aspects of their European Group-wide Finance Function.</p>

<p>I was asked to work on a variety of things. Sometimes, they wanted me to create something completely new (as they didn’t have the reports, processes, or systems in place yet), which is when I had to try and create and build things from scratch. Other times they wanted me to look at existing processes and systems and give my suggestions on how to improve them. So, it was something I was able to really learn a lot from.</p>

<p>Then, finally, I got to work on another project, but this time with Wunderman’s EMEAs Human Resourcing department, to help build-out some new Gender Pay Gap reports – something new that the agency wanted to start reporting on, as it had also become a new legal requirement.</p>

<p>At this time, a few months later, the agency had also announced that they were going to merge with another JWT, and that another 12,000 employees would be joining the business. This made me think even more of just how important the work I was doing was, and contributions I was making, was. Wunderman had also over those months called in some external contractors, to completely redesign, and re-furbish their workspaces and floor space, so this was also something that was going on.</p>

<p>The one last thing I would add here to this question is that it is still important to recognise that WPP is still a meritocracy. There are no clearly demarcated lines; and it is not the kind of place where you sit in a cubicle and do the same one thing over and over again. There, I found, that if are willing to roll up your sleeves, and have a go at something, then it had the environment and support network, (at least I felt), to ensure you were able to do just that. And, if you did well, you were encouraged to do that work again, and again, and again, coming up with new solutions to slightly different kinds of problems. And, in my case, I ended up working there for about 12 months.</p>

<p><strong>Really great Sachin! When looking back, over that period, I’m sure there is so much others could learn from the way you started and worked with their agencies. You obviously got on well with the people there, and they seemed mightily impressed with the work you were doing! Was that the case at all the agencies? From all of your experiences, what would you say is one of the single most important things you did, that allowed you to work on such a diverse range of projects?</strong></p>

<p><em>Very good question!</em></p>

<p>I’d say, initially, when I started, it was all about my ability to do what I said I could, and would do: to quickly and clearly demonstrate to the team what I had learnt in the area of “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” and to demonstrate to them, how I could apply these skills to solve the kinds of data problems they were having, in their Finance Department.</p>

<p>It was also about showing to them what my knowledge and skills in “Finance &amp; Accountancy” were like, and how I was able to effectively use and apply the materials and learnings from my MBA, to other departments across the wider business: in the case of WPP, this meant to the “Human Resource Management” department of a Marketing &amp; Advertising company.</p>

<p>After that, once I had established a basic level of trust, credibility and competence, it was then just all about building relationships. Everyone, I believe, in these kinds of companies, works hard. You can take that as a given! Everyone is very smart, and business savvy! You can also take that as a given! But then, what becomes really important is the ability to build relationships and do this in an emotionally intelligent, and empathetic way. So, soft skills are crucial.</p>

<p>If you can try to do all these things, and then create a network of people you can call upon, whenever you need to, and bring all their resources to bear, in any situation, that might call for it, then, I’d say you’d do very well! For me, that was a key determinant of the success I had when at Wunderman Thompson.</p>

<p>I will say, one thing though - it won’t work all the time – sometimes you find yourself in a situation, where things are just out of your control. For example, I personally had a really great time at the WPP agencies, “Wunderman / JWT, “Possible”, and “Geometry”, but not such a nice experience at their agency “Hogarth”. Though I was only there for a short time, I didn’t feel the culture was as nice as Wunderman’s (no group late afternoon Friday pub lunches, or Friday floor announcements), and, I also didn’t think that some of the departments at Hogarth were as well organised, or were tackling some of the agency’s issues in the right way, or doing this as well as some of the other senior people across the Group’s were.</p>

<p><strong>Well Sachin. Thank you for sharing this.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I think the key lessons I take from this are: demonstrating your abilities and competencies to do what you said you could and would do; the importance of establishing and maintaining strong relationships with the people you work with; and then, of how important the working culture and environment is, in for example, how it can affect an employee’s morale, employee’s engagement, their productivity, and ultimately effectiveness to the business – which at the end of the day, all links back to the Customer.</strong></p>

<p><strong>I know you probably can’t say too much about the kind of work you did, but are you able to tell us a little bit about how the demand for the “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” reports you had to create at WPP, changed or increased?</strong></p>

<p>Well, I think everyone, in every organisation, relies on having complete and accurate reports – whether it is their Finance function, their Human Resources function, their Procurement function, their Business Strategy function, or their Marketing function. You need these reports, to be able to make the right decisions to effectively operate as a business. They give the information needed for the business to make long-term “strategic”, “tactical”, and more daily “operational” decisions.</p>

<p>In my case, at Wunderman Thompson, at WPP, initially, there was a desire for some basic reporting systems, using the tools I knew of, to make sure that their reporting systems were complete, accurate, robust, easy to review, and update. That initial desire for some basic reporting then later grew into a desire to produce more sophisticated, more complex reports, that gave more detailed but still relevant insight, to help with decision making.</p>

<p>For the Wunderman UK team, working for the UK CFO, for example – the reports were mostly about what revenues they were getting from different clients. But then, when I worked for Wunderman Global, for their Global CFO and team – the reports were about showing this, but also about showing how the levels of working capital varied too across different clients.</p>

<p>Other reports I had created, for example in their Human Resourcing department, were built-up in a similar way: - I started out with some basic reports, and then these became more sophisticated and complex, with each iteration.</p>

<p>Over the 3 years I have been doing this kind of work, I can definitely say that more and more companies are now starting to better appreciate the kinds of problems that “BI &amp; Data” tools can help solve for different departments, and kinds of managerial insights they can provide, that say, older tools, like Excel, or PowerPoint used to be able to do - but in a much quicker, more secure way. And, in my case, I’ve seen an interest from people across the spectrum – from CAdminOs, CFOs, MDs, CTalentOs, Business Owners, CEOs, COOs, and Heads of Commercial Finance departments.</p>

<p>And it’s not just demand for “Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Visual Data Analytics” solutions either – there has been a lot of growth in other areas related to it - in the overall field of “Data &amp; Technology”. I don’t know the names all of these technologies (there are too many for just one person to learn in one lifetime), but one area I do know of, where there has been steep growth, has been in: “Data Warehousing”, and “Cloud Computing” services – particularly those offered by Technology providers such as Microsoft, on its Azure Technology platform, Amazon with Amazon Web Services, and Google with its Google Cloud Platform.</p>

<p><strong>Fantastic Sachin! So, you saw an increase in demand: from some basic reports, to then slightly more sophisticated reports, across quite a range of different business functions!</strong></p>

<h2 id="industry---diageo">Industry - Diageo</h2>

<p><strong>So then, after WPP, where you seemed to have got your second lucky breakthrough in the U.K., when looking for paid work, what did you do next? How did you go about finding your next customer? Because I can imagine, working through your own company, as an independent freelancer, that is something you constantly have to also think about, and work on?</strong></p>

<p>Well, yes that’s definitely true, one of the joys, but also drawbacks of freelancing, or working through a one-man start-up!</p>

<p>Well, after work had finished, I did the obvious thing, and asked the people I knew and had worked with at WPP, whether they needed any further help, or had any business projects or initiatives I could help with. Unfortunately, as the summer had just started, I was told it might be difficult to find work, but the MDs and CFOs I had been in touch with, said they would be on the lookout!</p>

<p>After that, I just tried to find work, from other people I knew in my business and family networks. Then an MBA friend of mine, who worked in one of the “Technology &amp; Innovation” departments at Diageo, (but now in “Strategic Tech” partnerships at Google) asked whether I could help out with doing some work for one of Diageo’s smaller “Corporate Venture Funds”. The Fund had started investing in several drinks start-ups and had been struggling to gather the data they needed, quickly enough, to prepare reports that could show how well their portfolio of company investments were doing.</p>

<p>I gave some initial thoughts and ideas, after having better understood the specifics of the problem, and then discussed and went through a solution with my MBA friend. After that, he then introduced me to various people at the VC Fund, and that’s how I got to start doing work for them and their team. Their team liked some of my advice and recommendations, and some of the reports I had started producing for them. And, I was able to work for them part-time, for quite a few months.</p>

<p>Though the Corporate Venture Fund was obviously a different scale from WPP, the work itself was no less difficult, and no less challenging. I would even go to say that some of the reports they wanted me to create for them, were conceptually more complex, and more challenging to make.</p>

<p>I would also say that it is also important to recognise that they are both very different kinds of businesses, in terms of size, stage of growth, and business situations they were going through. WPP, as a large listed FTSE 100 company, with a global presence, had its own challenges - and were going through a period of significant restructuring - e.g. merging of several agencies together, and simplification of its business).</p>

<p>Then, with the Corporate Venture Fund, the challenge had been in trying to sustain and keep up with a very high rate of growth, whilst still trying to maintain the quality of that growth (e.g. to make sure that any uncontrolled expansion did not lead to a wastage of company time, money, or resources – where, for example, operational processes did not flow smoothly, or where management were being forced to cut corners).</p>

<h2 id="other-questions">Other Questions</h2>

<p><strong>That’s an incredible transition Sachin! Working for one of largest Marketing &amp; Advertising companies in the world, helping them overcome some internal problems, in an industry facing its own challenges, all the way to then working for a small, very entrepreneurial, but rapidly growing, Corporate Venture Fund. I’m sure from your experiences, you’ve come to realise the importance of business networking, and how critical that is! What advice would you give to our readers when it comes to trying to establish a strong, and over time, successful business network?</strong></p>

<p>The first thing I would say, when it comes to networking, is do it smartly, because early on, it can be challenging! All those questions that you need to be able to answer, such as where and how do you start? I think, whatever kind of temperament or disposition you, as an individual, might have, if you’re starting something new, the early days are always going to be tough! – (unless you happen to be incredibly lucky and already well networked, which people seldom are - so you have to do the hard work of creating your own luck!)</p>

<p>So, my first piece of advice would be to - try to be organised and efficient about who you approach, and then how you approach them, to make sure your efforts are effective, and don’t go to waste. For example, applying to the same 3 recruitment agencies, by email – that you never get a reply from, means the agency is either not interested, hasn’t had a chance to reply, or that you’re one of those unlucky ones whose CV always ends up being put at the back of the queue.</p>

<p>If you do the same thing again and again, and nothing happens, then that is 4 weeks of wasted effort. So, try something new! Try calling some other agencies you know of, or, even some of their nearest competitors. If you’re as good as you say you are, at what you do, they’ll happily take your call! You’ll do well, if you persevere, in a professional way, and deserve it.</p>

<p>Also, know that 70-80% of all work (paid work) is actually found through networking, rather through advertised vacancies, (that is the plain truth of things!). So, if you can get people you know of already, to give you a referral, perhaps someone in a company you have worked at before, who already has quite a high opinion of you, then that should significantly increase your chances of securing a position where there is a vacancy!</p>

<p>Then, try to be proactive! So be seen, and get known, and try to take as many opportunities as you can to meet with people socially! Whilst a certain amount of networking can be done over the telephone, there is really nothing better than just going out, and meeting people in person, and telling them a little bit more about yourself, about the things you have done in the past, the things you are currently doing, and the kinds of companies or industries you want to work in next, and what you think the challenges and problems are in that industry, which you think you might be able to help with – (remember to have a printed copy of your CV, or business card, if you have one, with you!).</p>

<p>I think also, what a lot of people sometimes overlook, at least when it comes to business networking, is that anyone you meet, could potentially be a useful business network contact. I know, a lot of the time, that people prefer to just engage in their own private screening process. There is obviously a line to be drawn between talking to just anyone and everyone in the street, and talking to no one - but if you want to network more, in a way that you consider to be successful, there might be more events, situations, or places, than you “think”, that might qualify as “the right” opportunity!</p>

<p>I also think it is crucially important to go out with the right mindset! Go out with the mindset of offering your knowledge, skills, ideas, resources, and guidance freely – without any ‘hooks’ or “expectations’ or “repayment” in any kind. Doing this, as you ask thoughtful and considered questions, about the person you are meeting (rather than questions that bluntly and directly try to further your own interests), will help establish empathy! This way, even if you go out expecting nothing in return, the receiver just might be left with a very positive experience and memory of you, which they can act on, if they so choose, at some point in the future! You just never know!</p>

<p>Also, be prepared. Have some crisp information about yourself available so that your communications are short, focused and clear, in the time you have with that person. Then of course, try to have a good business card. Always try to be friendly, warm and sincere, and focus carefully on trying to learn (and remember!) people’s names. Ask for, and keep a copy of their business card, if you can.</p>

<p>Then, keep on networking, if you need to, even when you think you can stop! (And try to stay organised)</p>

<p>I know this might sound like a lot of advice, but I think you really need to keep working on all of these areas!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Sachin! This is really helpful advice! One thing I’d like to ask is you, is what do you consider to be your strengths and weaknesses. Also, how do you maintain a positive mindset? Because, like many others, I am guessing that you too have your ups and downs, and go through some good spells and some bad spells. What helps you stay positive?</strong></p>

<p>Well, in terms of strengths: I feel that one strength I have come to develop, and have gotten better at, over time, is commitment and focus. I think whatever you want to do, you should be really focused! For example, in an athletics class, you might find people who run to a line, but then stop three quarters of the way there, and start walking. You need to try to keep running! Whatever you want to do, you should be wholly committed, and focused!</p>

<p>Another strength I feel I have is being able to better approach things with an open mind. For example, writing management reports, or giving presentations, or doing public speaking, weren’t things I had that much practice in before my MBA. It wasn’t something I had to do much of before, in my earlier roles at PwC. But knowing how useful these skills were, I was really determined to work very hard at them. And over time, these are things I have become much better at!</p>

<p>In terms of weaknesses, I feel that sometimes I tend to struggle with time management - or I am always trying to find the right balance between both “time” management, and “attention” management.</p>

<p>I think personally, I can further develop and strengthen my leadership, communication, and negotiation skills.</p>

<p><em>How do I keep a positive mindset, and stay resilient when times are tough?</em></p>

<p>Well, I do this, partly by practicing gratitude! People often think that, in life, “happy people” are just born lucky – maybe because they were born in a wealthy family, born charismatic, born athletic, or born with other certain traits and abilities. But, really, happiness is a choice!</p>

<p>There are many things we can be grateful for!</p>

<p>For example, you could at any point, pay somebody to cook for you, and then have that person clean things up for you afterwards – you can go to a restaurant! Getting cooked and served food is something that so many people take for granted, because, in some parts of the world, they are so used to it!</p>

<p>I am also grateful for the fact that I have something called a refrigerator, where I keep and store food, so that after a few days it doesn’t go off. Other parts of the world, people don’t have a refrigerator, and are forced to eat food the day they buy it!</p>

<p>Another example is that when I turn the tap on, I get clean water. In many countries you can’t do that one thing; so that’s something to be really grateful for!</p>

<p>I think the act of practicing gratitude is something that is so very countercultural. We always like to complain about poor customer service! Practicing gratitude is something that really requires great discipline!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Sachin! Now, if you don’t mind, I have another question about Leadership. What would you say are some of the most successful character properties that one might need to have as a successful business leader?</strong></p>

<p>I think number one would be humility and responsiveness to feedback!</p>

<p>Often, as a leader, followers will want to just passively follow you, and do whatever you say. For example, you might think that because I’m the leader, I’ve gotten to the top, I know more than these other people, they will just follow me. But a lot of what you get from an organisation is what you get from tapping into the other people!</p>

<p>Also, I would say that a leader who is too autocratic is not using the power of his or her employees. For example, when I was on a factory tour at one of the Hitachi GST factories in Japan, I was shown by one of their Senior Engineers, how a new part of their production line, had actually been inspired through one of their employees suggestion schemes. It wasn’t the leader, the head of the department who thought, I know best, let me design it – the leader, in this case, listened to his and her employees.</p>

<p>Number two, I think, is being creative.</p>

<p>I remember, over one of the summers after my MBA, reading this book called Zero to One, by Peter Thiele, the founder of PayPal. It is also a book that Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla, – another person I greatly admire – also recommends.</p>

<p>In the book, Peter Thiele says that one of the most difficult things, when trying to start a breakthrough company is moving from “Zero to One”, rather than from “One to a Hundred”. Peter Thiele (&amp; Elon Musk) had created the very first online mobile payment system, PayPal – that was a “Zero to One”!</p>

<p>Now, there can be lots of replica companies, moving from “One to a Hundred”, but to do the first one, to move from “Zero to One” is extremely challenging! Peter Thiele, (&amp; Elon Musk), understood the importance of being able to think outside the box!</p>

<p>Third, just as with many other things, as I mentioned before, is commitment and focus!</p>

<p>You can’t be all things to all people! Peter &amp; Elon both thought, let’s just focus on launching PayPal, rather than thinking, I’ve got 100 ideas, let me try to look at them, all at the same time!</p>

<p><strong>Well Sachin, thanks for sharing your thoughts on this topic. I’m sure many of our readers will find learning more about Leadership really useful in their own careers and lives.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Now, I don’t want to say, “what’s next?”, because it’s pretty obvious you’re doing quite well, and plan to stick with the kind of work you are doing, for some time. You’re still very young, so is there a dream that is still to come, another goal that you’re working towards? What are you looking to do next Sachin? What is going to continue to motivate you?</strong></p>

<p>That’s a good question!</p>

<p>Well, overall, my work philosophy will always be to try to give myself, and other people the opportunity to be themselves and to be able to bring their very best at work! For the people who work with me, for people I work with, if I feel I can make a positive change and positive difference to their lives or work, that means I can carry on with doing my own fulfilling work!</p>

<p>So, if an opportunity presented itself, where I felt I could do something similar to what I have been doing, maybe in an industry that is very close to the industry I am currently in, then I guess I might be very open minded to that!</p>

<p>But as of now, I’m quite happy to continue doing what I am doing, providing what I believe to be an innovative business-technology service to companies in the “Media &amp; Entertainment” &amp; “Technology &amp; Engineering” sectors.</p>

<p>Though, I think it is impossible to exactly predict the future. And that’s what can make life so exciting! If new opportunities came my way, I wouldn’t just say: “<em>oh I never thought of this, let me just ignore this</em>”, I’d probably still remain very open minded to it! But this also doesn’t mean that I am “<em>going to be blown by the wind!</em>” - I am still going to maintain my “<em>focus</em>”. But, if a new opportunity did come along, and I decided that was for me, then that would be something I would steer myself towards.</p>

<p><em>What is going to continue to motivate me?</em></p>

<p>These I would say would just be my passions and interests – working with a bunch of smart, knowledgeable, hardworking, motivated people, that want to create and build new and innovative things to solve challenging, real-world problems.</p>

<p>I think a fast-growing Special FX studio, CGI Film Studio, A.I. / Machine Leaning driven - Electric Car Company, Hi-Tech Drone / Toy company, or even A.I. driven Health-Tech Start-up, supported by a large Corporate, or well-known Investor, might be other things I might be interested in being a part of.</p>

<p>Right now, though, I am just enjoying employing my Data Engineering &amp; BI skills, with what I have learnt from my MBA and ACA learnings and trainings, to different departments inside a company: be it their Finance; Marketing, Human Resourcing, Business Strategy or Procurement Departments to help the people inside them make better decisions - and be a force for good for both business and society at large. This is just something I hope to continue to do in my current and future roles - as I see a lot of scope for improvement, and growth.</p>

<p>I think the Nike Slogan from a series of adverts they used to run some time ago says: “<em>Impossible is Nothing!</em>”. Things are possible, if you really keep thinking, trying, and putting your mind to it - businesses can always keep improving themselves!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for that Sachin! Well, you definitely seem to be heading in the right direction! I think we’re nearing the end of this talk now. So now, I’d like to ask you two further questions, if you don’t mind. What do you think has made you the person you are today?</strong></p>

<p>Good question!</p>

<p>I’m think I’m just the combined product of all my past experiences.</p>

<p>Was it <strong>Chuck Palanuick</strong> who said, “<em>Nothing of me is original. I am just the combined effort of everything and everybody I have ever known”</em></p>

<p>I think there is a lot of truth to this saying. Over the years, I think I have just been extremely lucky to have worked with friends, work colleagues, career coaches, and mentors who have just instilled in me some great character.</p>

<p>And this is just huge luck of the people I’ve had the opportunity to work with – and why I still strongly believe that meeting new people and opening yourself out to new and different experiences, is critically important for ones own personal development - and something I am always pro-actively seeking to do!</p>

<p><strong>What is your definition of wealth and a successful life?</strong></p>

<p>I think there is no clear definition, because it means different things to different people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For some people, financial wealth is very important, not necessarily because they are materialistic, but because it is something their family never had – and this is one way they can achieve that level of comfort - or psychological peace of mind.</li>
  <li>For other people, it might be success with their career</li>
  <li>For some it might be family with other people.</li>
  <li>For others, it might be health and fitness.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me personally, after living in two very small rooms in London, I think my definition of wealth and a successful life, would be some combination of all of the above! You know,… the usual of what men seem to want these days, a large room, with a desk(!), a (solar powered) house, a nice modern (hybrid-electric) sports car, a nice kitchen, some gadgets and electronics, some financial security, etc.</p>

<p>I think, if there was to be a very strict definition of wealth and a successful life – it would be an intangible and general one – to just be happy and fulfilled, in whatever it is you do or want to do! But that of course, will mean different things to different people!</p>

<p>If you wake up and feel, “<em>I’m grateful to have this day</em>”, then that is a sign of real success! But if you wake up and think, “<em>I just need to get through this day</em>”, then that is a sign you might want to do something different!</p>

<p><strong>Thanks Sachin, that was really thoughtfully answered! Now, through your journey as a business person, can you tell us something that you’ve learnt, just about life, not necessarily about business, but just about life, and people. Is there any bit of advice in general, or thing(s) that you’ve learnt, that you’d like to pass on to our readers?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, it’s a very, very small world, and you should never – you must never – burn your bridges, because it will always come back round to you in the end, at some point in time, or through some channel! All of your actions, and all of your reactions, and the way you treat people, will always come back to you!</p>

<p>You know, that kind of golden rule, “<em>do onto others as you’d like done onto you</em>”. That sort of thing, is something that really resonates with me, and I think, strongly in business too.</p>

<p>Integrity is something you cannot regain!</p>

<p>I’ve seen time and time again, people burn their bridges, push themselves into a corner, and overreact, and overreact badly! (I’ve been guilty of it myself sometimes). But it does no one any favours! So, my one piece of advice would be just that.</p>

<p>Then, my second piece of advice would be to just be true to yourself. Work out what it is that inspires you and gets you out of bed in the morning. What are the one or two things that you really feel passionate about? Then put 110% of yourself behind achieving those things! I know it’s very general, but that’s the best way to achieve your goals.</p>

<p><strong>One last question, and I promise this will be the last. Why did you choose the name Star Tech Enterprises for the name of your freelance company? That’s quite an interesting name!</strong></p>

<p>Well, I wanted to go onto a mission to “<em>support businesses around the world – anywhere from large multi-nationals, medium-sized companies, to small and innovative start-ups, and help them achieve more! – particularly those in the ‘Technology &amp; Engineering’, and ‘Media &amp; Entertainment’ sectors</em>”.</p>

<p>And so, I wanted the name of the company to reflect this in some way. I chose the word “<em>Star</em>”, as I saw that as something that indicated excellence – just like what you see in the night sky, I wanted my company to work with an ambition and standard that was “<em>hotly plasmonic</em>”! Every individual, if they truly love their work, should “<em>reach for the Stars!</em>”</p>

<p>Then I chose the word “<em>Tech</em>” because, personally, I believe in the continued application of both Science and Technology as requisites to a healthy and modern society – in making the systems and cultures we live in, more predictable, more effective, and more enjoyable, so that we may all live happier and healthier lives.</p>

<p>Then I chose the word “<em>Enterprises</em>”, because, just like the great explorers of “<em>The Starship Enterprise</em>” from the T.V. series Star Trek (directed by J.J. Abrams), I wanted the company’s name to reflect the same values of its daring Crew of voyagers - that is: “<em>to seek out new discoveries</em>” and “<em>to boldly go where no man or woman has gone before</em>” – always with an “<em>adventurous spirit</em>”, and always with a “<em>high sense of courage, boldness, and ingenuity!</em>”.</p>

<p>Hence, when combined together, you get the name “<em>Star-Tech Enterprises</em>”</p>

<p><strong>Sachin! Thank You very much! That was a very wide-ranging conversation! You have been having quite the career thus far. May it go well and continue to go well for you! I am certain many who read this will have learnt a lot from what you have shared.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If people want to reach you what is the best way for them to get in touch?</strong></p>

<p>It’s been an absolute pleasure, Harsh! Thank you for having me. I can be contacted on LinkedIn or via my email address: at <strong>sachin.tandon@startech-enterprises.com</strong></p>
