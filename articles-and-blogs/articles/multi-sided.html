<p>Next week, I am excited about starting a course called <strong>Digital Economy: Foundations and Strategies</strong>. I have been reading up about various topics related to this area, including a few articles on what I find to be quite a fascinating topic: <strong><em>Multi-Sided Platforms</em></strong></p>

<p>I thought I would write this to share some of what I have learnt from so far, in particular what from an article I read on: <em>Strategic Decisions</em> by <em>Andrew Hagui</em>.</p>

<p>So what is a multi-sided platform, where do we see it, and what can we learn from it?</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>A Multi-sided platform is a (almost always) technology platform that creates value - primarily, by enabling direct interaction between two or more groups of participants. Although we may not immediately realise it, we see numerous examples in our day to day lives, in the form of differennt business models: <em>AirBnB</em> (that connects dwelling owners and renters); <em>Uber</em> (that connects professionals and passengers); <em>Facebook</em> (that brings together users, advertisers, third party game and content developers) to video game console makers (that connect Users with game developers, and sometimes third party vendors).</p>

<h2 id="so-should-we-care-about-multi-sided-platforms">So, should we care about Multi-sided Platforms?</h2>

<p>The answer should become clear if you consider that some of the largest and fastest growing businesses of the past few years have been multi-sided platforms. They have been enormously successful, creating enormous value, because amongst other things they do two things really well: reduce transaction costs (think <em>eBay</em> and <em>Amazon</em>) and reduce search costs (think <em>AirBnB</em>).</p>

<p>They differ to traditional product platforms and resellers because they directly connect users with each other (unlike resellers). The end customer is also a direct customer of the platform provider, rather than an intermediary.</p>

<p>A unique feature of a multi-sided platform is its “<strong>indirect network effects</strong>”. Sellers get more value when there are more buyers, and vice versa. There can sometimes too also be economy of scale benefits - the more users on one side that join, the more the users on that side, that benefit.</p>

<p>Being an MSP can sometimes be a double edged sword and is not without its problems. For example, with no one side wanting to join without the other, overcoming the chicken and egg problem is a major challenge. Who takes the plunge first?</p>

<h2 id="how-many-sides">How many sides?</h2>

<p>Another, quite useful question for those considering designing a multi-sided platform, is: how many sides you should bring on board? <em>Linked-In</em>, for example, connects users, recruiters and advertisers - three sides. It has considered attracting an additional side, such as corporate users, but not without some trepidation, worried that this may not be welcomed by some of its individual users. So while inviting more sides might allow <em>Linked-In</em> to grow, it could increase the risk of friction internally, and so too the costs of operation.</p>

<p>Looking at another industry, one might say that <em>Google’s</em> Android, and <em>Apple’s</em> iPhone are in fact not as similar as one might think. <em>Apple</em> has traditionally been to a two sided model - connecting end users (you and me) to application developers. And although being two sided limits the scale of increase that Apple can achieve, it has allowed it, arguably, to produce much higher quality hardware-software systems than its competitors.</p>

<p><em>Android</em> on the other hand is a three sided platform, connecting users, developers, and third party OEMs. As a result, it has been able to create a much larger ecosystem, with <em>Android</em> devices now accounting for over 65% of the smartphone market, worldwide! Though unlike Apple, it has not been able to command the same premiums or customer loyalty rates that it might have initially hoped for.</p>

<p>So there are trade-offs that are not always easy to make. Do I attract more sides to create larger network effects, and potentially, more diverse sources of revenue, (such as <em>Linked-In</em>) but at the risk of creating too much complexity, and conflicts of interest between the multiple sides, or… do I focus on fewer sides, focusing on providing the best functions and ground breaking features to only a few participants that I really need to please? The answer is not a simple one!</p>

<h2 id="how-should-i-price">How should I price?</h2>

<p>The next question that is often asked is: what should the pricing structure be? In reality, although many MSPs serve multiple customers (and so offer the potential for diversifying their streams of revenue), many have discovered that they have to offer their services for free, or at subsidized prices to at least one side, to derive profit from the other side. Essentially, cross-subsidizing prices, depending on various factors.</p>

<p>So what pricing considerations should be taken? Here are some basic, but important principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>For each group, charge a higher price to the group that is less price sensitive</strong></p>

    <p>This will depend on the availability of substitute services, and the bargaining power the MSP has over a particular participant group, and is typically the approach that many MSPs take. Think about video game consoles - the loss making side are its end users, and profit making side are game developers. With <em>Ticketmaster</em>, the profit making side are its end users and loss making side are venues / event organizers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If there is no priced transaction between the sides, charge more to the side that stands to benefit the most</strong></p>

    <p>This explains why business conference organizers typically charge attendees but not invited speakers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>If there is a priced transaction between the two sides, charge more to the side that extracts more value</strong></p>

    <p>For example, if A gets a particularly good deal from B, charge more to A, so as to not excessively penalize B to avoid it not getting enough value from the MSP to warrant participation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>The increasing awareness of the power of MSP business models and their success have prompted many entrepreneurs and investors to attempt to identify and build their own.</p>

<p>The model, if really thought about, can be found in the most unusual of places!</p>

<p>Take the Shopping Mall, Roppongi Hills. Tokyo’s best known real-estate complex that functions as an MSP, and which brings together office tenants, retail tenants (shops, restaurants, hotels, movie theaters) and more than 40 million visitors each year. The Mori Building company that develops and manages the complex insists that its occupants differentiate themselves by keeping their stores open for longer and by selling very unique merchandise, requiring them to also contribute human and financial resources to promotional activities.</p>

<p>The challenges however are common ans still remain, no matter what the MSP. These need careful thought, and include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The chicken and egg problem inherent in launching any MSP business</li>
  <li>Resistance from MSP constituents who don’t want to do things at the behest of a powerful MSP</li>
  <li>The sheer complexity of running an MSP business with conflicts of interest.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you can make it work successfully, the rewards to be reaped are very substantial!</p>

<p>Let’s see what my Business School professor’s views are on this next week!</p>
