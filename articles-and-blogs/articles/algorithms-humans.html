<h2 id="humans-supreme">Humans supreme?</h2>

<p>We as homo-sapiens – as possibly the most intelligent and successful genus, or species, on this planet - like to imagine ourselves as being uniquely capable of a whole range of different things - that we are uniquely talented, and that there are certain things, certain jobs, that we, and we alone, are capable of doing!</p>

<p>Over the past few decades, we have also started to realise, and become more willing to accept, that machines (and the algorithms that run these machines) are now very capable of outperforming many of the tasks that we thought were ours, and ours alone, to do!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-algorithms">What are algorithms?</h2>

<p>We can all appreciate that the word “<em>algorithm</em>” can mean different things to different people, and therefore, trigger very different kinds of emotional responses amongst different groups. For example, to some people, the word, “<em>algorithm</em>”, might want to make them gouge out their own eyes out. To other people, the word “<em>algorithm</em>” might, instead, make people feel quite mildly aroused!</p>

<p>Whatever the word <em>algorithm</em> may mean to you, many of us today know that all an “<em>algorithm</em>” really is, at least by its widely accepted modern definition, is something that takes an “<em>input</em>”, passes it through a series of “<em>logical steps</em>”, and then from those steps gives a final, end “<em>output</em>”.</p>

<p>So, if you were making a desert, as a food to eat, after a main course of a meal, then “<em>A sun-kissed, golden-honey, sticky-toffee pudding</em>”, is something that you might consider to be, (at least by its above definition), an “<em>algorithm</em>”. Your inputs are the ingredients, the logical steps are how and when you use each of those ingredients, and your output, at the end, is your “<em>sun-kissed, golden honey, sticky toffee pudding!</em>”</p>

<p>Given all the things we have seen and learnt about in the world today: from how the things we humans have made, “<em>actually</em>” work, to the different ways we have used what we have made, to better trade and transact with each other – some of the things that “<em>algorithms</em>” can do today - in terms of furthering our knowledge, understanding the world, and advancing our intelligence, as a species, more generally, are nothing short of truly remarkable!</p>

<p>For example, just by considering some of the modern day applications of where and how algorithms are used, we can think of algorithms that have been developed to catch robbers; we can think of algorithms that have been developed to drive cars; we can also think of algorithms that have been developed to detect and diagonose certain kinds of diseases - and which can do these things, much, much better, than we as human beings can.</p>

<h2 id="so-where-do-we-fit-in">So, where do we fit in?</h2>

<p>It is important of course to recognise that the world we inhabit, today, is not just about the algorithms we use to run the things all over it! The world we live in today is also about “<em>you</em>” and “<em>me</em>”, about “<em>us</em>”, and about where and how we, as “<em>human beings</em>”, fit into the bigger picture, in terms of the kind of future world we want to live in!</p>

<p>When it comes to algorithms, we can’t just think of them as things you can just build, know whether they are good or bad, and then put back on the shelf, in complete isolation! We also have to think about some of the really important ethical questions that our increased adoption of algorithms in our lives is likely to raise. For example: how much, or to what extent can we really rely on algorithms? And what kinds of decisions should we really allow algorithms make for us?</p>

<p>For example, most people realise that they can’t always rely on other people to do the things they want them to do. “<em>Human beings</em>” are, after all, “<em>human beings</em>” - we ourselves are not totally infallible! On the other hand, though, when it comes to machines and algorithms, sometimes, people make the mistake of putting a bit too much faith in them, and let them take a bit too much of a driving seat in those aspects of our lives that aren’t necessarily so deserving of our trust!</p>

<p>If people think about the topic more widely, we can see the same patterns emerging, or very similar versions of the same story repeating itself, over and over again - of people just giving up their powers a bit too willingly to a machine.</p>

<p>Most of us today, both those of us in the workplace, and those of us at home, already know that if you have enough “<em>data</em>” about people (whoever these people may be), that you can work out very different kinds of things about them. For example, you can work out what they might want to buy when they go shopping. You can also work out who they might want to vote for in an election. You can even work out whether they might go on and do something bad in the future.</p>

<h2 id="can-we-rely-on-algorithms">Can we rely on algorithms?</h2>

<p>Sometimes yes, sometimes no!</p>

<p>Take, for example, the algorithm called the “<strong><em>recidivism algorithm</em></strong>”. This is an algorithm that is sometimes used to help judges in courts predict whether a defendant will go on to do a bad thing in the future or not.</p>

<p>But given how complex, and sometimes complicated legal cases in courts can be, and the fact that there can be so many ambiguous “<em>grey</em>” areas, you also need to ask yourself, would you really always trust what an algorithm predicted for you, and take that as gospel? The answer to this question of course really depends on how well you know that algorithm! But, even still, there can always remain some doubt!</p>

<p>Let’s say, for example, that you have done a small bad thing, and as a result of this small misdemeanour, you find yourself in “<em>the dock</em>”, with a decision that now needs to be made about your future! In this situation, who would you rather presided over your future? Would you rather it be a “<em>human being</em>”, or would you rather it be an “<em>algorithm</em>”?</p>

<p>Some people might say “<em>human being</em>”, because they believe there to be more bugs and errors in a computer or algorithm, or because they just feel more comfortable with a “<em>human being</em>” making a decision about their future, than an “<em>algorithm</em>”.</p>

<p>Other people, however, might say to this question, “<em>algorithm</em>”, because they are very used to the fact that “<em>human beings</em>” can very frequently make mistakes – that “<em>human beings</em>” often give a much bigger range of answers, than say what an “<em>algorithm</em>” might give. These other people may also prefer an “<em>algorithm</em>”, because they trust “<em>algorithms</em>” a lot more, because they believe “<em>algorithms</em>” to be much less biased!</p>

<p>When it comes specifically to considering the reliability of “<em>human beings</em>”, there is a lot of evidence to suggest that the error you get in human decision-making can be a very real problem! For example, if you look at decisions made by judges in legal courts, just as a simple example, you often get what very many people might consider to be very inconsistent results!</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Different decisions being made, for the same type of case, by different judges, or</li>
  <li>Different decisions being made, for the same type of case, still by the same judge, but, this time, on a different day</li>
</ul>

<p>There are others studies that also show there can be other factors that influence a judge’s decision making, when, really, you think they shouldn’t.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Judges being a lot stricter in towns where the local sports team might have lost recently.</li>
  <li>Judges making different decisions at different times of the same day.</li>
  <li>A Judge’s being hungry affecting the decision they make.</li>
  <li>Judges not wanting to make too many of the same decisions in a row, for example, when you might see judges suddenly becoming a lot stricter, (for no apparent reason), after giving several favourable verdicts in a row.</li>
</ul>

<p>And there can be many other things, small things, remote things, seemingly disconnected things, that you may have not have initially considered, that can lead to this inconsistency issue with human decision making.</p>

<p>But this, of course is where “<em>algorithms</em>” step in, because of their great ability to help deal with these human inconsistency issues!</p>

<p>Now, often, the question that gets asked, which one is better than the other?</p>

<p>There is seldom a universally single best choice - whether you choose to go with a “<em>human being</em>”, or whether you should choose go with an “<em>algorithm</em>”! It very much depends on the problem you are trying to solve, and for what country, industry, company, etc., and in what particular situation.</p>

<p>Then you need to think about what specific skills and expertise you think you need, what specific skills or expertise you think you already have, and then how you can best bridge any gaps, using either “human beings” or “algorithms”.</p>

<p>For example, in some cases, you might favour an “<em>algorithm</em>”. In others, however, you might favour a “<em>human being</em>”, because you think even “<em>algorithms</em>” can sometimes make mistakes. They might not make the same mistakes with everyone – the mistakes might not be uniform across the board - but they can still, nonetheless, sometimes make mistakes (sometimes even calamitous mistakes)! And in those cases, in those situations, where they are more likely to do that, you would prefer a “<em>human being</em>” helping to make any decisions for me.</p>

<p>One thing, in this topic of “humans” and “algorithms” that you think would be very important to answer is when exactly a “<em>human being</em>” can or should be allowed to overrule an “<em>algorithm</em>”?</p>

<p>For example, going back to the example of judges in legal courts, judges themselves are just normal people - very well trained in their professions, but still just normal people. And so, (depending on the specific facts of the case), if an algorithm is already being used to help make predictions or decisions - even judges are not always going to have the foresight to know when exactly to overrule that algorithm, and just rely on their own instincts - maybe the judges don’t trust their own instincts because they’re missing some important facts or information, and would prefer to just let the algorithm make that decision for them!</p>

<p>As humans, therefore, this is something that we should really acknowledge - that the algorithms we have invited in, to make some of the decisions in our lives, do sometimes, have these deep-hidden biases in them, that cause them to make what most of us would be considered to be incorrect decisions!</p>

<p>“<em>Algorithms</em>” are, after all, just constructs of our own “<em>human</em>” minds. They are not going to understand the world in quite the same way that we “<em>humans</em>” do. They won’t, for example, understand things like “<em>context</em>” as well, and they won’t be able to interpret the very many other subtle “<em>nuances</em>”, of this world that only we “<em>humans</em>” understand.</p>

<p>For example, in certain applications of the real-world, such as human scale “<em>object detection</em>” in film and computer imagery, an algorithm will often still get outperformed by a human being. And given that “<em>image recognition</em>” is something that is now being used, more and more, in our daily lives, the fact that algorithms still get outperformed by humans in this field, is something important that we should all really start to recognise and acknowledge!</p>

<h2 id="the-story-of-the-health-and-welfare-department-in-idaho">The Story of the Health and Welfare department in Idaho</h2>

<p>Consider, for example, the story of what happened with the use of an “<em>algorithm</em>” in Idaho, a few years ago, in 2014. In this real life story, there were 16 disabled residents of Idaho, who had one day received some unexpectedly bad news! The “<em>Department of Health and Welfare</em>” had introduced this new budgeting tool – with the idea that it could be used to more quickly, and in a more automated way, calculate how much “<em>state benefit</em>” each of these residents might be entitled to.</p>

<p>Now, these residents of Idaho had some quite severe disabilities, so this money, really, was quite important to them in making sure they could keep their independence. Although many of them did qualify for institutional care, many of them were instead still being cared for at home. So, one by one, each resident went into the “<em>State Department</em>” to find out how much money the “<em>algorithm”</em> that was being used, had decided they would each be entitled to.</p>

<p>Bizarrely, some people found out that they were entitled to much more than they had got in previous years. Others, however, found out that they were in deficit of tens of thousands of dollars!</p>

<p>Now, from the outside, no one could work out how on earth this thing, this “<em>algorithm</em>” was making its decisions. To many in the government department, it looked like it was just plucking numbers up at random. But the problem was that these people had too easily accepted the notion and idea that it would just not be possible to argue with a computer – they had all become just a bit too trusting of the algorithms output!</p>

<p>So, in the end, these residents, out of frustration, brought up a class-action lawsuit to have the algorithm turned over, so it could be properly scrutinised. And when it was scrutinised, it was only then, when the residents had discovered that this algorithm – that this “<em>one</em>” computer algorithm, that had so much power over their lives - it wasn’t some kind of “<em>super-sophisticated</em>”, “<em>artificial intelligence</em>”, like they had all been led to believe. It wasn’t a “<em>super-slick</em>” “<em>mathematical model</em>” either. It was, in fact, just quite a crappy excel spreadsheet! One that had errors all over the place. One that had bugs in the data, and one where the formulas were actually all in a mess. In fact, the maths in this spreadsheet was so bad, the judge eventually ruled it unconstitutional!</p>

<p>So, the moral of the story here is that once you dress something up as an “<em>algorithm</em>”, or as a bit of “<em>artificial intelligence</em>”, there is a very real danger that it can take on this “<em>magical</em>”, or “<em>unearned</em>” “<em>air of authority</em>” – if not properly tested and scrutinised!</p>

<h2 id="algorithms-helping-cure-diseases">Algorithms helping cure diseases</h2>

<p>Moving away from dodgy algorithms being used at “<em>State Welfare Departments</em>”, to some of the fantastic things that “<em>algorithms</em>” can do, one of the things that algorithms have actually become really good at, is curing diseases. And in this area of “<em>algorithmic development</em>”, a lot of people have been doing some really, really incredible stuff!</p>

<p>Most research on the topic says, that in principle, if you wanted to design an algorithm to diagnose whether you had a particular disease, or not, (for example, breast or prostate cancer), there are two areas that you will want your algorithm to be good at:</p>

<p><strong><em>Sensitivity</em></strong></p>

<p>The first is you would want your algorithm to be really, really sensitive. That is to say, you would want to make sure your algorithm caught every single bad / cancerous cell, or group of cells, that might be hiding amongst that vast array of cells.</p>

<p><strong><em>Specificity</em></strong></p>

<p>The second thing you would want, is for your algorithm to be really, really specific. So, for example, making sure that your algorithm did not lead to too many false positives, (i.e. flagging of too many normal cells or tissues, and labelling them suspicious, when in fact, the cells were ok). So, you would want to make sure that the algorithm was as accurate as it could be in all of its assessments.</p>

<p>Now, you might think, with these principles in mind, that everything now becomes quite simple. For example, if you want to design an algorithm to diagnose breast or prostrate cancer, for instance, you just turn up those two dials, and you are kind of done.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it’s not always that simple – because with algorithms, these two dials tend to be locked with one another! That is, turning one dial up, can often mean having to turn the another one down. And this means you can inadvertently design something that might be considered by many to actually be quite a “<em>crappy algorithm</em>”!</p>

<p>A 100% sensitive algorithm, for example, isn’t going to be all that helpful in terms of actually diagnosing people. Instead, algorithms need to be designed to try and do their very best, and this is done by trying to play to the strengths of these algorithms, - and some algorithms have some almight strengths!</p>

<h2 id="the-nun-study">The Nun Study!</h2>

<p>Now, consider the “<em>Nun Study</em>” for example carried out a few years ago. This study showed the cognitive ability of 678 nuns collected by the epidemiologist, David Snowden.</p>

<p>At the beginning of this study, these nuns were aged between 75 years and 103 years old. And David Snowden, the lead person conducting the study, was able to persuade these women that every year of their lives they would take this short cognitive test, where, for example, they might be asked for things such as, how many animals they could name in a minute.</p>

<p>Now, some degree of cognitive decline happens to everyone as they get older. Those with significant early declines can end up getting dementia. But there are others, who still remain very sharp, well into their older years.</p>

<p>In this study, not only did David Snowden manage to persuade these women to take short cognitive tests every year, he also managed to persuade these nuns to donate their “<em>actual brains</em>” to this project after their deaths. (these were incredibly generous women, from the School Sisters of Notre Dame Kentucky!)</p>

<p>The reasons the donations were made, was to see whether the people who showed actual signs of dementia in life, might also show physical signs of the disease (e.g. lesions, other hallmarks etc.) in their brains on their passing away.</p>

<p>You might be forgiven for thinking these two things to be quite closely correlated (signs of dementia and physical signs of the disease in the brain). But the study found there to be some people who actually really bucked this trend. For example, “<em>Sister Mary</em>”.</p>

<p>At 101 years old, she was incredibly sharp, right up until her death, doing crosswords, puzzles, and all other kinds of different things. But when her brain was dissected after her death, it showed all of the hallmarks of having the onset of the disease. In fact, there were barely any differences between her brain, and those of others, of a similar age, who showed much greater signs of cognitive decline.</p>

<p><strong><em>So, what on earth is going on here?</em></strong></p>

<p>Why are some people able to resist showing the symptoms of cognitive decline, or dementia, when they have this stuff going on inside their minds, when others are not able to resist these symptoms of dementia and cognitive decline?</p>

<p>It turned out that the clues for this actually hid in another data set altogether, one that was created decades before any of these women, ever showed any signs of dementia.</p>

<p>Because the team that did this study also had access to the essays that these women wrote when they entered their sisterhood, (when they were 19 and 20 years old), they were also able to identify some very simple patterns in the “<em>actual language</em>” these nuns used in their essays - patterns that would help the team predict which women would go on to develop dementia later in life, and which women would not.</p>

<p>Their main finding was that the people who did not show any symptoms of dementia, used a much more complex, much more densely packed language, with a much more varied vocabulary, to express their thoughts and ideas - compared to those women who did go on to develop dementia, who tended to use a much simpler, much less varied vocabulary and language.</p>

<p>Now being able to detect small clues, and small differences, such as this, is something that algorithms can be really amazing at! They can look and find tiny clues, in seemingly quite disconnected data sets, and can help make really big predictions in the very long term.</p>

<p>In fact, when it comes to disease diagnosis, many of the algorithms we use today cannot only just tell you about what you have in your body, they can also make some fairly good predictions about what your long-term chances of survival are - based not only on just what bad or cancerous cells you might have, but also on what you might have in the “<em>surrounding tissue</em>” - which is something that scientists are still trying to work out, exactly, what it is they’re picking up on!</p>

<h2 id="sensitivity-with-humans">Sensitivity with Humans</h2>

<p>It is important to remember that a highly sensitive algorithm does not always make for a perfect algorithm! Sensitivity is only one half of the equation.</p>

<p>When it comes to being sensitive, “<em>human beings</em>” are really not all that great. In fact, some people might say we are totally “<em>rubbish</em>”. And this fact is something that was really quite well illustrated through quite a cunning experiment, carried out by some Harvard scientists, on some radiologists, back in 2014.</p>

<p>What the scientists had done was they had called in these professional radiologists, just to see how sensitive their eyes were. They then showed them this image of a lung to ask them to have a look. They then used this eye tracking software to see where their eyes were going. The surprising result of the experiment was that in 83% of the cases, these professional radiologists failed to spot that the Harvard scientists had hidden a picture of a “<em>Gorilla</em>” inside the lung scan!</p>

<p>Now, if you’ve got professional radiologists missing Gorillas in lung scans, you can imagine how many diseases might end up getting missed! As humans, we are not all that great at sensitivity, especially when compared to machines. We miss things all the time.</p>

<h2 id="specificity-with-humans">Specificity with Humans</h2>

<p>Specificity, on the other hand, being specific, that is like our superpower. If you have a fully trained radiologist or pathologist, for example, they will almost never misidentify a perfectly normal set of cells as cancerous, when they are not (or vice versa) – it is something that almost never happens. This is something we have become incredibly good at.</p>

<h2 id="working-together">Working together!</h2>

<p>So, when it comes to both “<em>human beings</em>” and “<em>algorithms</em>”, we should just accept that neither humans nor algorithms are ever going to be perfect, all day, every day, all the time!</p>

<p>An rather than choosing between a “<em>human being</em>” or “<em>algorithm</em>”, which is kind of the rhetoric we hear so much of today, wwe should exploit each other’s strengths and just create much more of a partnership. This is indeed what is happening now, in the way that many disease diagnoses are being designed.</p>

<p>With enough compute power, an algorithm is not something that is ever going to get tired! So, just let it trawl through all of that data and highlight a few key areas of concern. A human being is also seldom ever going to misdiagnose. So, human beings can then later come in, have the final say, and make the final decision! So, humans too, also play a really active role to play in all of this!</p>

<p>This version of the future is one we should all hope for! One where we can start embracing the flaws we see in algorithms, but also one where, we can start to recognise and acknowledge our own shortcomings!</p>

<p>This should be a future where we can take algorithms off of the “<em>pedestals</em>” and start treating them like we would any other source of power – by questioning: how that source of power works; by calling them out for their errors and mistakes; and by giving them feedback, in the hope that they will learn and get better!</p>
