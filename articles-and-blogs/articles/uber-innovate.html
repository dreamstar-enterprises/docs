<p>Launching so quickly, in so many countries, Uber has now become a sprawling global enterprise. But early on, it had to address many difficulties on its rise to the top: retaining a tightly knit, start-up culture and mentality, overcoming constant regulatory changes, differentiating itself from new competitors, building partnerships in tough markets, and hiring, retaining and motivating the right people in far flung locations.</p>

<h2 id="interview">Interview</h2>

<p>In this talk between Randy Komisar, Partner at Kleiner Perkins, and SVP of Business at Uber, we learn about some of the many lessons and challenges Uber had to overcome through the growth phase of its international expansion - as it grew from: scrappy startup, to now market leading global taxi service company. Randy Komisar starts with the following question to Uber SVP:</p>

<p><strong><em>How does Uber make strategic business decisions in an evolving economy? What does the SVP of business do?</em></strong></p>

<p>The SVP of business is broad enough to encompass a whole range of things.
It is about business development and corporate development, then raising money, M&amp;A, strategic partnerships. It also includes marketing, and perhaps high-end government relations where the nexus between business and government is important. This is particularly true of many companies in Asia, where being able to influence the government to have regulations that support you is critical to success.</p>

<p><strong><em>How has Uber grown?</em></strong></p>

<p>Uber, just under a decade ago was in 40 cities, 16 countries. Today they are in 58 countries, 330 cities, doing 2-3 million trips a day, with 350 employees, that’s about 10 times growth in the number of employees.</p>

<p><strong><em>How have things changed in the organization, culturally and strategically?</em></strong></p>

<p>Culturally, being in every single time zone means you have to have a 24/7 operation. You have to have a culture that is resilient and can take on constant new developments that happen, whether regulatory, accidents or opportunities, competitors raising money - lots of things can happen in all corners of the globe.</p>

<p>You also get to a point where you can’t interview everyone who joins your group. That is probably when you get passed 50 people. This is hard because they are far flung, and you have to trust other people to do the hiring, and to make sure they carry your cultural values out to those people. So even if they are in an outpost in Nigeria, they should reflect the company’s values in some ways, in addition to the local market environment. So it’s a real challenge!</p>

<p><strong><em>What many people admire about the leadership team at Uber, in the essence of the disruption they have created, is the underdog spirit, because there are many forces entrenched against so many companies that are innovating. As Uber has grown from being a scrappy start up to now a leader in its market, how have you been able to retain that underdog spirit?</em></strong></p>

<p>Because of the size we have become, it’s important that our stature is reflected in our outward attitude. In the past few years we have taken many pains to grow the way we have with the world, without losing the underdog mentality.</p>

<p>Each city effectively functions as its own business unit; they have their own p&amp;l and do their own hiring. So you really do push out a lot of autonomy to the field. This is important because regulations on transportation are typically decided at the local level.</p>

<p>Most public transport infrastructures are overloaded right now, and Uber has become a little bit of a release valve for this in a lot of places.</p>

<p>Also, ‘<em>developing</em>’ world trends are different to ‘<em>developed</em>’ world trends. Take a city like San Francisco. They’re not building a new subway; they’re not building any new stuff. Buses are packed, everything is packed!</p>

<p>If Uber can reduce congestion because cars don’t circle for parking, save fuel, and are carrying multiple people, then Uber adds to the infrastructure of the city.</p>

<p><strong><em>What ways, if any, have you used to throttle down the underdog spirit because now you are the leader, for example, the messaging around stewarding of the entire industry, rather than you against your direct competitors?</em></strong></p>

<p>When you’re building a big company, in some ways you’re building a civilization, in that its got to take into account all kinds of factors that you wouldn’t think about as a scrappy start up.</p>

<p>In the cities where we are big, we are a pillar of that community! People rely on us, people want to make sure we’re doing good for that community, giving rides to handicaps, or serving underserved areas. So you truly have to become part of the fabric of that city or country. That means you take moral responsibility for acting like a good citizen.</p>

<p><strong><em>Was there a certain time or inflection point when you started to feel that way?</em></strong></p>

<p>We started to feel that way when we saw that every city Uber had launched in, the product market fit was there.</p>

<p>What we’ve uncovered is that getting from point A to point B is a basic human need. Its not as high in the hierarchy as food, shelter and water but getting from here to there is on a hierarchy of needs, and if you have a simple product that works, people all over the world want to use it.</p>

<p>When you figure this out, you realize the only thing limiting my growth is how fast I can launch. When we are in 4 continents across the world that’s when we say ‘we have a global business on our hands’ and when we have to take care to make sure that the outside world knows what kind of people we are.</p>

<p><strong><em>Let’s talk about partnerships and making deals. It’s sort of a controversial topic for start-ups because as an investor you look at a really early stage company and the adage goes that they should focus more on organic growth, namely, “getting the fly wheel to spin on magic of the initial product”, and then worry about the partnership later. Do you agree with this, and if so, at what stage in the life cycle of a business do you feel partnerships really start to matter?</em></strong></p>

<p>It sort of depends on the nature of the business, and I will give you some examples. In our business, it’s not just a technology business. We are real metal and real cars that are taking people to places! The online / offline component means that we are as much of a business business as a tech business!</p>

<p>We had to partner with, in the early days of Uber, big car fleets. They had supply! We had to do deals with insurance companies, auto manufacturers, loan providers, and gas companies. So for our business it’s imperative and existential to have a strong partnership function, and it has been since the beginning.</p>

<p>If you’re Facebook or Google and you have servers and you’re designing a product, partnerships are less important. You’re looking for the vitality or ingenuity that can pick up on itself, that doesn’t have to scale in human dimensions but in dimensions of servers. So it’s different.</p>

<p>Take Instacar also - they have to do deals with groceries, store companies, and they have partnerships that they have to do too. So it does depend on the nature of the business.</p>

<p>I am biased of course! Even if you had a tech business, you’ve got to be out there building relationships, because someday you will need partnerships to accelerate your business, or to take on new territories or to do M&amp;A, or all those things.</p>

<p><strong><em>On global expansion or just market expansion by cities, Investors often look for companies that are disciplined when choosing to focus on growth in existing markets versus expand into new markets. Uber has obviously done this with new cities in the US, and it has also been done in countries outside the US, in countries such as China and India, and Europe. What is the discipline that is important for start-ups to enforce as they think about same store sales growth, versus new store sales growth?</em></strong></p>

<p>Once we found product / market fit, we found more users than we could handle. We did this in ten cities in the US, then we tried one in Europe, then one in LatAm, and one in Asia, and we tested each: culture, size of city, everything. We said ‘wow’, it kind of works everywhere. Then, it’s all about getting scale faster.</p>

<p>We stayed in San Francisco for one year! Only San Fran. Then New York was our second market for the next nine months. So we were only in two markets, until we had really perfected how to operationally do this. We had a playbook and figured out who to hire for the next ten cities.</p>

<p>Uber still is a sprawling enterprise to manage. I won’t say we’ve managed to solve the problem of how to roll out and manage a company that is as big, but we certainly know we have something, and how to launch it, such as operationally, what type of people we’d need to hire to get in. I wouldn’t have scaled in this way if I didn’t know how to make it work in 5 to 10 markets.</p>

<p><strong><em>For companies that are looking to expand into China, and India, do you have any sort of general advice you would give?</em></strong></p>

<p>You’ve got to be prepared for China. Competitiveness is fierce there. All kinds of tactics that we wouldn’t use here are used there. You have to be resilient enough to withstand them.</p>

<p>In the Chinese consumer market, they subsidize consumer services for a lot longer than we (in the US) before turning to profitability, so you have to have the balance sheet go the distance.</p>

<p>You’ve also got to have local Chinese people in your company who can work on the ground, to interact with the government, to understand the business culture, to read the ‘tea leaves’ as it were, to understand the things you might miss because they’re being translated.</p>

<p><strong><em>Do partnerships matter more in those markets?</em></strong></p>

<p>Our partner there is Baidu. Its investors are Alibaba and 10 cent, two of China’s biggest tech companies. They got together, which is rare for them because they are mortal enemies from a business standpoint.</p>

<p>So what’s my strategy to compete in China? Differentiation! Our products are very differentiated. Uber was the first company in China that did peer to peer (private cars) giving access to a pool of supply that is amazingly large. We were able to take that risk and it gave us much faster supply growth than our competitors. So there are some key product differences.</p>

<p>Then there are tech differences. Uberpool, which we just launched in Chengdu, China, is a massively complex big data algorithm problem, that, to make the economics work, you have to be very good at.</p>

<p>Also the brand stuff. Chinese citizens respect American brands. They love Apple, so there is some brand differentiation there.</p>

<p>We announced that we are raising money for our Uber China subsidiary there so that local Chinese investors can get exposure to Uber China.</p>

<p><strong><em>A key part of your growth and expansion of your team has been your ability to hire an outstanding team. You’ve seen that at other organizations that have scaled. I’m wondering what have you learned over the years, in terms of hiring, retaining great talent, that sort of thing?</em></strong></p>

<p>My weakness is that I do less training by formal training and more of “let’s just put them in the mix and see what they can do”!</p>

<p>I think I’ve built one of the best teams around. I think what I’m looking for, as part of our cultural values, is some fierceness, someone who is willing to have the confidence to go and do things that are seemingly impossible.</p>

<p>I think if you asked someone, does Uber have a shot of being the biggest foreign tech success in China, at a ground level, many would say hell no, but others would say hell yes. I like the people who have the latter mentality.</p>

<p>Motivating them is easy when you can back them up with a great product! They have a force of a great product, and also consumers love it. Those two combined keep them motivated!</p>

<p><strong><em>Have you found that your selection process to determine that tenacity is probably non-linear? Its probably not standard interview questions. What kinds of things are you looking for?</em></strong></p>

<p>I like people who are multi-disciplinary. I do have a lot of former bankers and lawyers, the most useful though are enterprise sales people, people who’ve had to use every tool in their belt to get something done.</p>

<p>I ask seemingly innocuous questions like, how do you work with a lawyer on a deal, and if that person says - ‘<em>the lawyer has their part, they do indemnities, and limitation liabilities, and I do the business terms</em>’ – you’re out! Because this means you’re not curious! They really need to dig into understanding what it takes to get a deal over the finish line, which is part sales, part finance, and part legal.</p>

<p>So we look for people who have the breadth and curiosity and who can put in the whole strategic effort to make it something.</p>

<p><strong><em>Now, you’ve got both a business background and legal background. How important is having a hybrid background in what you do?</em></strong></p>

<p>When I first started in this job, Uber had just raised the round it raised from Google, about two years ago, and that was a quarter of a billion dollars. Since then we have raised six billion dollars. So I feel like I’ve been using my finance skills more than my legal or business skills.</p>

<p>The lawyer stuff (in my case) just helps you structure something to get over the finish line, but its useful.</p>

<p><strong><em>How do you retain that consistent cultural DNA despite the fact that you’re in so many markets? Each market sort of functions as its own start up, in terms of that tenacity, that fear and that culture. How do you retain that common denominator?</em></strong></p>

<p>We have a very sophisticated interview process that we’ve honed over time, so we can get cultural matches really fast!”</p>
