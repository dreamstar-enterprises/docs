<p>Here, Satya Nadella, current CEO of Microsoft, on his recent visit to India, openly talks about his apprehensions in giving speeches to large audiences; what he believes are the true drivers to innovation; the opportunities and challenges ahead of us in an increasingly digital ‘<em>mobile first, cloud first</em>’ world; the core values and early beginnings of Microsoft; and finally, principles on his secrets to success: one’s energy, mental attitude, EQ, learning ability, keenness to spot and raise standards, and finding a deep love and passion for what you do.</p>

<h2 id="public-address">Public Address</h2>

<p>“<em>Thank you so much. I mean, it’s just a privilege to be here. It’s a humbling experience. This morning, I landed in Delhi, then I was driving up and we passed a place where I grew up in. We passed Bigyan Bhavan. I grew up exactly opposite that in middle school, and I remember this one lecture that I attended, maybe in the mid 70s, or late 70s. It was given by Subramanian Chandrashekar, who went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics. I mean when I went and saw that, I somehow just recall what an inspiration that speech was.</em></p>

<p><em>In fact, little did I know about the calling that I would be faced with much later in life. It was an inspiration. God, I’m going to be here today, talking to the youth of India. What a fantastic opportunity, and then it dawned on me, ‘oh my god’, I don’t have a Nobel Prize for sure. What am I going to do? Then all the nervousness set it. How exactly am I going to start this? Believe me you, this is perhaps the most nervous speech I am going to give on this trip, because it’s just fantastic to be talking to the youth of this country.</em></p>

<p><em>The energy is palpable, the optimism is palpable, the confidence is here to be seen. In the day and a half where I’ve had the chance to meet many people, in India, broadly, I have been able to get that sense.</em></p>

<p><em>In terms of the opportunity in front of you, it is just tremendous. I don’t think ever in our history we had this kind of opportunity that you are going to have, as you graduate, as you prepare… as you prepare to make a dent in the universe, as you prepare to really change the world. The opportunity in front of you is unparalleled.</em></p>

<p><em>It really comes down to the ingenuity of the human capital in this country. In terms of what it is that you are going to do, and shape, and change.</em></p>

<p><em>The other thing that strikes me, perhaps more so than ever before is that most of the opportunity and change gets created by people with very diverse set of backgrounds, coming together to innovate.</em></p>

<p><em>When I think about our business, it’s no longer just one field of engineering, or one specific focus on just STEM education, but perhaps, more so than ever now, its people coming from a design sensibility, people coming from engineering backgrounds, people coming from economics backgrounds, and business. Because if you look at what is happening today (in India), look at the business model innovation, look at the designs that are made from this country, and at the same time the engineering skills - it’s that coming together, that multidisciplinary approach to innovation, which is what I believe, all of you represent.</em></p>

<p><em>We definitely and clearly are going through a massive technological shift. I describe it as this mobile first, cloud first world. It’s this very rich canvas for innovation, this canvas that talks about the mobility of the person, the human being. It’s not really the device that’s mobile; it’s you who is mobile. You get up in the morning, you have access to the information. You go to your college, you have access to a different device with more information. You then come back home and you’re reminded of what you have to get done. It’s this continuous mobility and the ability of all the computing power around you that helps power the rich experiences. That’s the mobile first world that we live in.</em></p>

<p><em>This mobility comes about because of this rich cloud infrastructure, and in particular the ability of this infrastructure to reason over (and make sense of) the information…the data. In fact, the way I describe it is that every device, every experience, creates this exhaust of data, and the cloud (and the power of the cloud) can convert that into the fuel and the intelligence that powers every one of your experiences. That’s the mobile first, cloud first experience. That’s the mobile first, cloud first world that we live in.</em></p>

<p><em>We at Microsoft are excited about creating the platforms and the productivity tools that we want to make ubiquitous so that you can take advantage of them, to truly capitalize on this world. That’s what we get a kick out of. That’s what we believe is our job. In fact, every time we have approached anything, we have approached it with that sensibility that we want to create the broadest, deepest platform for others to build, for others to create, for others to make. That’s what we are at the core.</em></p>

<p><em>In fact, when Bill and Paul Allen started the company 39 years ago, we started out as a basic tool, that’s how Bill wrote the basic interpreter, and that’s how the journey got started. That’s at the root of this company, and that’s how we’ve always come back to that core. How can we create platforms, how can we be the tools provider, so that others can realize their full potential? That’s what’s really inspired us, and today, we have some amazing capabilities.</em></p>

<p><em>This morning we even launched our commercial services in data centers, in India. It creates another level of playing field. It just creates world-class cloud infrastructure that you can take advantage of to fuel your imagination.</em></p>

<p><em>Now, the thing that perhaps more than anything else will shape your own destiny is the approach, and mental attitude that you will take as you pursue your journey.</em></p>

<p><em>I would say it’s too early for me to be very reflective, because after all, I’m just getting started on my own new journey, but I did think that its probably appropriate for me to atleast share with you, what I think can be some principles you could use, maybe some hints that you could use, as you approach both the opportunities and challenges that you’re going to be faced with.</em></p>

<p><em>The first is the energy that you create around you is perhaps going to be the most important attribute you will bring to others. In fact, one of the things I’ve always asked and debated myself is “Is it IQ or EQ?” I do believe that in the long run, EQ does trump IQ, because without the ability to be a source of energy for others, very little can be accomplished, and anytime I’ve had the opportunity to learn from that, and reflect on it, in the way I’ve approached things, I’ve felt I was able to get to better results.</em></p>

<p><em>The other piece that perhaps most shaped me in my journey was this constant quest to learn. Every opportunity I got, I took as a learning experience. In fact, one of my biggest privileges in the last 7 months was meeting so many distinguished people, across different walks of life, and get all kinds of advice, (and believe me CEOs are great at giving advice). Talking to them, you learn a lot. Being able to constantly pursue that, and push yourself (!) - to have your antennas up!</em></p>

<p><em>In fact, the way I have tried to derive some energy is to figure out who is setting some standards? And you can see it, quite frankly. Everyday, somebody has got some idea or some way to do something, which sets a new standard, a new bar, for you to get inspired by!</em></p>

<p><em>Lastly, perhaps most important of all, is that you have to fall in love with what you do! Because everything else then simply becomes easy. If you just are so passionate about what you do, one, it doesn’t feel like work for sure. More importantly, it is perhaps the best way to find meaning in what you do.</em></p>

<p><em>I was just thinking about what’s the best way to capture this? I remember reading this Gandhi quote, which I think is the most appropriate way to capture it. He said something along the lines of saying</em> “<strong><em>Live everyday as if it’s your last day, but learn as if you’re going to live forever!</em></strong>” <em>I believe this captures the essence of how I think the youth of this country can face the future and the opportunity ahead.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you so very much! It was just a privilege for you to have me.</em>”</p>
