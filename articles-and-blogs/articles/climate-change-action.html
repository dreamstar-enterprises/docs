<h2 id="pulling-off-a-historic-energy-transition">Pulling off a Historic Energy Transition!</h2>

<p>We are lucky, in some regards, in the United Kingdom. In most of our cities, the air does not smell smoky, dirty, sooty, or sulphurous. Or at least, when many centuries they did, they no longer do!</p>

<p>You step off a train, and you will not be greeted by a dozen coal power plants, or a line of open-pit coal mines as far as the eye can see. For most parts of the country, people do not have to accept that a coal economy will power their livelihoods.</p>

<p>So, we are fortunate in this respect!</p>

<p>There are parts of the world, though, where communities do live next to coal plants, and wake up every morning only to find their homes coated in a fresh layer of ash, from the smoke their local coal plant continuously belches.</p>

<p>And it is not just coal that hurts, it is their deadly addition to fossil fuels. The fossil fuel pollution alone that results can reduce people’s life expectancy by up to 10 years! And although the skies may have cleared briefly during the coronavirus lockdown, as cars stayed off the roads, factories shuttered, and power plants ramped down – the consequent economic dislocation puts hundreds of communities, and regions, at risk of falling to deeper into poverty.</p>

<p>People should not have to sacrifice development for breathable air. And the development I see in clean energy in the world around me, dares me to hope that the planet can pull off one of its most important energy transitions yet. And it is a choice that will make or break the world’s fight against climate change!</p>

<p>A lot of people live in countries across the world live in rural areas. And as heatwaves, as we have just witnessed in the United Kingdom, Western and Central Europe (and elsewhere in the world), become more frequent, (a prediction scientists have been warning us about for a long time), our thirst and demand for energy to want to, for example, have air-conditioners to live modern and dignified lifestyles, is likely to only to continue to increase.</p>

<p>By 2050, to cope with the increasing temperatures, more people will want to cool their homes. The problem is though that if by 2050, the planet still gets the same proportion from fossil fuels, as it does now, it will be a disaster for everyone! And most immediately for those parts of the world that are already vulnerable to pollution, climate change, and our rapacious demand for fossil fuel forms of energy.</p>

<h2 id="climate-change-goals">Climate Change Goals</h2>

<p>So, what countries across the world need to do, is to make “renewable energy”, the beating heart of their reimagined economies, by, for example, setting itself 3 climate change goals.</p>

<p>First, the world needs to build solar and wind power at an unprecedented scale and speed, replacing its reliance on gas, and coal-fired power plants.</p>

<p>Second, it needs to extend the reach of this renewable energy to power sectors of the economy like industry and transportation that haven’t traditionally used electricity (and have always in the past relied on fossil fuels)</p>

<p>Third, the world needs to become radically more energy efficient.</p>

<p>So, what does this all mean? Well, for many countries, it does mean building gigawatts of solar and wind power!</p>

<p>Some countries in the world, for example, are blessed with abundant sunshine. Other countries in the world, are, for example, blessed with plenty of coastal wind. Some even have both! Wind and solar are forms of renewable energy that really complement each other well, because the wind often blows harder when it’s less sunny, like just after a heavy rainstorm.</p>

<p>Wind and solar power are now also cheaper than coal power. Batteries too have also become much cheaper to product, which now makes it possible to store and deliver energy on demand. And as costs of fallen, so the demand for renewable energy has risen rapidly. But it will need to grow “even more” explosively through mid-century!</p>

<p>This is the critical decade to invest in solar and wind power and avoid, for example, locking in new, long-lived coal power plants!</p>

<p>Countries too also need to much urgently expand their electricity grids to deliver power for massive solar and wind plants to their energy-hungry cities. Not all renewables should be built at massive scale. Distributed solar, on the rooftops of warehouses or the outskirts of sprawling cities, can also produce power close to where it’s needed!</p>

<p>Nuclear and hydropower will of course also be essential to energy transitions around the world too. But this said, many countries lack the state capacity needed to build complex pricey projects at a breakneck pace!</p>

<p>The second goal is to use renewable energy across the economy, including in sectors like industry and transportation that don’t use electricity today, and have traditionally been powered by fossil fuel forms of energy.</p>

<p>As rising renewable energy makes the power grid cleaner, countries should make for example all of its trains run on electricity and move more heavy freight from heavy trucks to rail. All road vehicle fleet can also go electric!</p>

<p>To accelerate the adoption of electric cars, scooters, motorbikes, taxis and buses countries should build out charging stations, across the nation, not just around their capital cities.</p>

<p>Electrification won’t work everywhere. It may not be possible to use electricity to power some heavy industrial processes in the fast-growing steel, cement, fertilizer and petrochemical sectors. Such industrial plants can though contribute, and add for example, equipment to capture carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Another solution could be clean hydrogen. Surplus renewable electricity can run machines called electrolysers that can split water into oxygen and green hydrogen fuel. This hydrogen can then power applications in transportation and industry, such as making steel or chemicals.</p>

<p>Hydrogen can also act as a battery, storing surplus wind and solar power to be used later.</p>

<p>Finally, the third goal of the world and many countries needs to be to radically improve energy efficiency.</p>

<p>Energy efficiency is important to every and any country in the world! Even if countries build a massive supply of renewable energy and extend the reach of that energy by stitching together their economies, it won’t be enough without energy efficiency!</p>

<p>If our voracious demand for energy rises too quickly, it will have to fill the gap with polluting fossil fuels – and that is something, if nations want to reach their “Net Zero” goals, or governments want to achieve some of the “Sustainability Development” goals set out by the United Nations, or businesses and corporations their “Environment, Social, and Governance” goals – do not want – the needless burning of more fossil fuels!</p>

<p>Some countries, states, and counties have a big advantage in attaining this goal, in that they can start from largely a clean slate. This also presents a huge opportunity to enact stringent efficiency standards and design energy-efficient buildings, villages, towns, and cities.</p>

<h2 id="climate-change-challenges">Climate Change Challenges</h2>

<p>There are challenges, of course to all of the above!</p>

<p>First, electricity distribution utilities that are currently being mismanaged, which are economically fragile and forced to subsidize power to certain sectors, need to be reformed to more efficiently combat energy poverty. This needs to be done whilst overhauling unprofitable utilities so they can pay for clean energy on time. If such changes are achieved, this will make it possible to raise trillions of dollars to finance the world’s clean energy transition.</p>

<p>Second, any energy transition will stall without new and improved technologies!
There is, therefore, a huge economic opportunity for countries to cultivate advanced clean energy industries! Doing so will in turn open up opportunities for countries to export energy-efficient transportation equipment, even equipment that can be used to produce and use hydrogen and become leaders in digital energy technologies!</p>

<p>International communities should work together on this, by funding innovation that makes energy transition faster and more affordable.</p>

<p>Countries should partner with each other to build projects on the ground to demonstrate critical technologies, such as long-duration energy storage and carbon capture.</p>

<p>Third, and finally, coal isn’t going away without a fight. It’s big business across the world! Private coal companies are pushing ahead to expand coal mining, even deforestation!</p>

<p>Renewable energy offers the world a cleaner and more prosperous future than coal, gas, and fossil fuels, ever will. Unless we hasten the transition, air pollution and climate change will continue to ravage countries across the world and endanger the planet.</p>

<p>So, let’s all be in haste, and get to work!</p>
