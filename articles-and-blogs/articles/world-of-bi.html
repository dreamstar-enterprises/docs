<p>Many tools are now coming up in the Business Intelligence (B.I.), and as expected, users now want to understand the differences between Product X and Product Y. One of the most common questions asked in user group sessions is, “<em>can you provide a comparison between this product and Product Y</em>”.</p>

<p>The answer is almost always, “<em>No, a comparison cannot be made, without first understanding the deep difference between them</em>”</p>

<p>Two such tools, Power B.I., from Microsoft, and Tableau, from a start-up in Palo Alto, are tremendously powerful data modelling tools that just happen to come with a pretty face; most other products are beautifully crafted reporting tools with a pretty face, but the only thing they have in common is a pretty face! If you stop at what they have in common, you are only comparing a small fraction of the whole product, and that would be unfair!</p>

<p>To go further, a deeper understanding of basic B.I. concepts is needed.</p>

<p>Beware, I am biased! I love Tableau, and I love Power B.I. and, I’ve been enthusiastically thundering out projects recently, with some great companies, using both these tools!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I am a professional; I started working with Business Intelligence some time ago, mostly since after finishing up with my MBA, and so I have some experiences to share! Here I would like to help you understand what you really need to evaluate when making (or reading) any comparison between different BI products.</p>

<p>At the top level, any Business Intelligence solution is composed of three layers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raw data: these are the data sources that one wants to analyze. Raw data comes as is.</li>
  <li>Semantic model: this is where data is re-arranged and optimized for analysis. This is also where one defines the calculations required by the reports.</li>
  <li>Reports: these are the nice dashboards you can build with the tool.</li>
</ul>

<p>Tools such as Power B.I., and Tableau, manage all three layers: you start with raw data, you build a semantic layer, and finally, you prepare the reports. Most other reporting tools are focused on just the last layer and are limited in the previous two. In other words, they are missing the capability to build a real semantic layer. So what is a semantic layer?</p>

<h2 id="semantic-models">Semantic Models</h2>

<p>Before, there was a clear separation between users and developers. A B.I. developer would build a project to help users extract insights from their data, and build reports. Users did not need to understand tables, relationships, or calculations. The developer oversaw shaping the tables, providing pre-defined calculations and giving sensible names to entities. Leveraging the semantic model, users did not have to know DAX, M-Code, MDX or SQL.</p>

<p>A semantic model lets users interact with business entities like customers, sales, and products. Users would place those entities in reports made with Excel or with other reporting tools.</p>

<p>Regular users were happy with just Excel and a Pivot Table, but more advanced users wanted more powerful tools, and it is precisely this that led to the creation of several reporting tools with their ad-hoc programming languages to create more advanced formulas. Regardless of this though, no matter how powerful those tools were, they were still reporting tools based on the existence of a previously crafted semantic model. No semantic model, no reporting!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, building a B.I. project took time, and users were hungry for reports! This led to the start of the Self-Service B.I., which allowed users themselves to build reports – reducing development time, and, crucially, building a democratic knowledge of the data!</p>

<p>This is where we are today! Driven by the market, several vendors have started to build self-service B.I. tools. A few new products appeared on the market, and starting with their existing tools, they had and evolving into new ones. Thus, depending on where you start, there were two options for an existing product to evolve into a self-service product:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you already had a semantic modelling tool, the software needed to add reporting capabilities. It needed to make it easier to use, because the target was no longer a B.I. professional but a regular user instead.</li>
  <li>If you already had a reporting tool, you needed to add the capability to build a semantic model because your users needed to massage the data and build calculations on top of the resulting model.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, in the end you obtain a tool that mixed the capabilities to create a semantic model and build reports. After this first step, you can add tons of different features like share with other users, build wizards to automatically connect to other services, improve the formula language and so on. But the core is always the same: a semantic model and a reporting tool, bound together in a nice package!</p>

<h2 id="comparing-tools">Comparing Tools</h2>

<p>Though something like Power B.I. can be considered a new product, it is actually the evolution of Tabular. M-Code, and Power View. Other vendors took similar steps, with different starting points, but it is fair to say that several vendors started from a reporting tool, and added the semantic model to it.</p>

<p>Now, if you need to compare two BI tools, you need to compare at least these two features: the semantic model and the tools to build a report.</p>

<p>Say you wanted to compare Product X with Power B.I.; you show how easy it is to build a gorgeous report on top of an SQL view, much easier and more powerful than Power B.I.. Great! But you are only comparing a fraction of both products! Reporting-wise, sure, Product X is better than Power B.I.. But there are other considerations too: can you load multiple tables in Product X? Can you build relationships between them? Can you use a programming language to author complex calculations that involve scanning different tables? All these operations belong to the semantic model. A fair comparison needs to apply to all these features.</p>

<p>This is what tools such as Tableau and Power BI offer you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>M-Code – a data transformation tool which is easy to use and incredibly powerful. It can load virtually anything and join data from different sources.</li>
  <li>A modelling environment where you can build different kinds of relationships between tables and powerful data models. It does not hurt that it runs on top of one of the fastest databases ever built.</li>
  <li>DAX – a programming language which is not easy, but lets you author nearly any query and calculation.</li>
  <li>Power BI / Tableau – a reporting engine which is very good in building dashboards and reports. It can also be extended with custom visuals and third-party products.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, there is web-based reporting and sharing, a mobile experience, the ability to load from nearly any data source in the cloud, or on premises, and many other useful features. Yet, the core is composed of the four features above. If you want to compare apples to apples, you need to compare at least these four parts! Be mindful: you need all of them! A tool that requires you to build a single table because it does not let you relate two tables is nothing but a nice reporting tool. Here, comparing it to Power BI or Tableau, does not make much sense.</p>

<p>The semantic model (in Power B.I.) itself is based on DAX. DAX is not an easy language, but its complexity does not exceed what is needed to author complex calculations. DAX does not offer a standalone function that computes MOVINGAVERAGEOVER30DAYSNOTCONSIDERINGWEEKENDS. Instead, it provides the building blocks to compute this calculation, and much more. If you cannot compute something in DAX, it is likely you don’t know the language yet. DAX has much to offer!</p>

<p>Finally, reporting. Reporting is only the last part, even though it is the most visible one. You might find other products are better than Power B.I. or Tableau when it comes to reporting. This is fine, if you are aware that you are only comparing a fraction of Power B.I. or Tableau with the whole of Product X!</p>
