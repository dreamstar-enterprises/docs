<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Kelvin Au is the Global Managing Partner of the Founder’s Factory, a London based VC fund, that helps start-ups develop, test, and scale their business ideas.</p>

<p>As most VCs go, it’s quite a fascinating company - although it has been in business for only 4.5 years, it has been undergoing tremendous growth – with more than 100 start-ups in its portfolio; offices in more than 3 countries (with plans to expand further); and expertise developed across a range of verticals (from A.I. &amp; Big Data, Education, Beauty, to Media, Retail, and Travel)</p>

<p>And, the company provides a whole host of services.</p>

<p>Asides from giving founders and their teams a place to work from, the company provides mentorship and support in writing and delivering pitches, creating financial models, refining investment thesis, validating term sheets, cap tables, and so on.</p>

<p>Beyond this, they also help organise regular showcase days, so founders can practice their pitch, meet and network with potential investors, and talk to other people interested in their business and industry (such as people interested in working for a start-up, or, people with their own business idea interested in becoming founders themselves one day)</p>

<p>And they’re investing in some really interesting start-ups! From start-ups that are developing advanced robotic kitchen equipment, to those that are combining A.I. with Big Data to help insurance companies price premiums to individuals, more personally, based on their lifestyle, personal preferences, past credit score, purchasing habits, and so on.</p>

<p>With the fast pace at which technology has been advancing, and with so many entrepreneurs aspiring to apply technologies in new and ambitious ways, just how do VC’s go about researching and sourcing from the 100s of thousands of potentially investment prospects out there…beyond considering just the high-level ideas of: big market, breakthrough product, and great entrepreneur, how do they practically go about connecting with specific founders and companies?</p>

<p>Here are some key learnings:</p>

<p>The specific tactics that VCs use for sourcing and researching prospects do vary widely, but broadly they can be broken down separately, into outbound and inbound efforts.</p>

<h2 id="outbound">Outbound</h2>

<p>These are efforts, VC investors themselves intiate, often by asking for following 3 questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What kind of companies are ‘interesting’ to me as a VC?</li>
  <li>How do you find out about these interesting companies?</li>
  <li>How do you connect with the CEOs and Founders of these companies?</li>
</ul>

<p>Determining what kind of company is interesting is largely a personal or VC firm-wide decision. Though, a few common ways you’ll see VCs define this, is by:</p>

<h3 id="signs-of-rapid-growth--inflection">Signs of rapid growth / inflection</h3>

<p>It’s easier for a VC to believe that companies that are already growing, will continue to do so, than those that are doing the opposite. Investors here will hence try to look for companies with a high revenue growth. And if revenue is not disclosed, will be looking for high growth in number of employees, or high growth in web traffic.</p>

<p>There are some companies in the industry that have built their own proprietary models to help investors do this, such as Bloomberg Beta, GV, SignalFire, etc.</p>

<h3 id="industry-technology-or-theme-interest">Industry, technology, or theme interest</h3>

<p>Most VCs will start out by focusing on a particular sector, technology or theme, with a strong belief that existing dislocations in these industries, technologies, and themes, create the very conditions and opportunities needed for start-ups thrive.</p>

<p>To this end, an investor might thus start their search by focusing on a particular technology (e.g. simulation companies, if they were looking at companies that they thought could branch out into autonomous cars). Other investor’s may filter their search to something that is more geography + stage focused (for example, those wanting to see all companies raising seed rounds in Sweden - if that’s where they believed conditions for incubating and investing in start-ups were high)</p>

<p>After investor’s have done this, their focus then becomes with identifying + connecting with specific companies. These steps include accessing:</p>

<p><strong><em>Identifying</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Industry reports + market research</em></strong>: E.g. software reviews + research sites like Gartner, and Thomson Research, Capterra, but also a proliferation of other industry maps, and PDF reports across the web.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Startup directories</em></strong>: Pitchbook, CB Insights, Crunchbase, Tracn, Product Hunt, BetaList and a number of others fall in this category.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Startup media sources</em></strong>: TechCrunch + Term Sheet / Pro Rata are well known, but there are many others (especially on a per city or per theme basis).</li>
  <li><strong><em>Startup job listing sites</em></strong>: Even companies that are deliberately avoiding press + being listed in directories, will be looking for talent on job listing sites</li>
  <li><strong><em>The portfolios of upstream investors</em></strong>: If you’re a Series A investor, chances are the companies you’re interested in have already raised seed funding. So, a natural hunting ground for these investors (as a Series A investor) will be companies that have already secured investment from local seed or angel investors.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Proactive outreach to referral sources</em></strong>: there are lots of people in an investor’s network that may refer you to deals if they think of you – investors can help trigger this by proactively reconnecting with them on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Connecting</em></strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Asking for introductions</em></strong>: when done well, can improve the conversion rate from cold email to first meeting quite a bit. Unfortunately, this is tricky today because it can be hard to know how well an investor’s teammates actually know someone.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Cold outreach</em></strong>: Whether via email, phone call, or other mechanisms</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Identifying + connecting</em></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Conferences</em></strong>: These can be great in that they generally self-select for people who care about + operate in the areas that match an investor’s thesis.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Events</em></strong>: Accelerator demo (or showcase) days, and meetups can also be another targeted way of meeting companies and people with similar areas of interest.</li>

<p>While outbound is an important channel for deal sourcing, the majority of VC deals have historically come from trusted inbound sources!</p>

<p>In fact - you can see much of the content that VCs create (podcasts, video series, blogging, and tweets), and the effort that VCs put into creating this content, as a way of generating inbound leads (while influencing outbound ones).</p>

<h3 id="referrals">Referrals</h3>

<p>Most inbound efforts for VC investors that result in a deal comes from <strong><em>referrals</em></strong>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Referrals</em></strong> are implicitly hierarchical by their very nature - driven by the strength of the relationship with the source, how well the source knows the start-up’s domain + the importance and quality of people in question (e.g. domain or technical edge, superior knowledge they posesses, past experience and track record), and what their motivations are!</p>

<p>Some examples of inbound <strong><em>referral</em></strong> sources for a VC investor will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Entrepreneurs + portfolio companies</em></strong>: Great operators tend to know other great operators - which can turn into a powerful source of deal flow when cultivated well!</li>
  <li><strong><em>Experts in a field</em></strong>: As a VC invests in + builds a network in investment themes (whether intentionally or as a consequence of opportunistic investments), this newly created network will encompass practitioners + industry experts, who may in turn also refer the investor to companies that they find interesting.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Other VCs</em></strong>: These could be co-investors trying to syndicate a deal, existing earlier-stage investors trying to help a company pursue follow-on funding, investors who aren’t a stage / sector fit for the company in question, or investors that have chosen to pass on a particular deal.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Limited Partners</em></strong>: Given they can often be invested in a VC fund, they’re also incentivised to make it successful by passing along quality deals to the VC, and may also be a good source for referrals</li>
  <li><strong><em>Service providers</em></strong>: Lawyers, accountants, brokers, and others who work with early stage companies + founders.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Bankers</em></strong>: Typically hired by founders to help them manage the fundraising process. At the early stages, this is usually frowned upon (as VCs are investing in the founders, and their ability to manage the fundraise themsleves). But in the later stages, involvement from banks becomes more common - and at the PE end of the scale, it’s rare to see companies not represented by the deal making department of a major investment bank.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Friends / personal network</em></strong>: people you went to college with, worked with in prior jobs, etc. can also tell you about / introduce you to companies over time.</li>
</ul>

<p>While many VCs don’t respond to cold inbound emails and most will not prioritize them, some great companies that have lacked connections to a firm have sourced some great investments in this way!</p>

<h2 id="so">So…</h2>

<p>…These are just some of the different approaches that a VC investor will typically use to go about researching into and sourcing, a potentially world-changing start-up!</p>
