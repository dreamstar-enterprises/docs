<p>Some interesting insights into hiring, management, and culture:</p>

<h2 id="have-a-hiring-committee">Have a Hiring Committee!</h2>

<p>People look for confidence, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and intelligence. These are all attributes in people in theory we hire for. When one company did a study on the interview process, what they saw is that often an interview becomes an exercise in confirmation bias. The interviewer often makes a snap judgment based on a thin slice of interaction, and assumes that that gives them insight into how the person actually is. Without consciously being aware of it, they then look for data that affirms this hypothesis they’ve developed. As a result, most interviewers, in fact most of us, (unless we were trained psychologists) are just average at interviewing.</p>

<p>To combat this, what some companies have figured out is that it is sometimes better to have a committee to assess people. Somebody does the interviews, everyone writes things up and then sends a pack to a committee. The committee’s sole job is to maintain quality. The hiring manager doesn’t get to choose, the team doesn’t get to choose, they do their write up, but the committee makes the decision, and that decision cannot be questioned. Their entire job is to keep quality high.</p>

<p>Evidence shows that hiring this way seems to get better. One company taking old data, periodically, from five years ago, ten years ago, and more, when they rated candidates through the committee against their standards of today, found that the assessment given to old candidates was worse on the assessment practices they did today, versus those done on new candidates. So, one big thing a company can do is to hire objectively by having a hiring committee.</p>

<h2 id="have-structured-questions">Have structured questions</h2>

<p>Another thing they found is structured interview questions. Many companies like to ask brain teases and case questions, but it turns out that this often isn’t the best way of predicting performance. There is no correlation.</p>

<p>Part of the reason for this is that these tests often test for a finite skill, rather than flexible intelligence, which people often want to hire for. Structured interview questions are often screening for problem solving, and then the interviewer drills down. These kinds of questions are more predictive of how someone will actually perform.</p>

<p>Founders are often a special category, because there is something that people are looking for, but hiring, no matter how big or small you are (if you struggle to get a committee), shouldn’t be based on one person’s opinion.</p>

<h2 id="the-forgetful-manager">The forgetful manager</h2>

<p>We’ve all been managed and what we want when we’re managed is to get our work done. We would like to set a goal and then not let people get in our way to achieving that goal. However, when we become managers, instead we want to make sure other people get their work done. As a result managers often get into their business about all kinds of things they often shouldn’t. If you’ve done hiring right and hired exceptional, capable and motivated people, you often need to manage them very little. So part of the issue with management is that they often forget everything you knew about what you disliked about being managed. And as an organization gets bigger they’re also managed by someone above them.</p>

<h2 id="being-less-than-truthful-and-peer-feedback">Being less than truthful and peer feedback</h2>

<p>The other problem is that when you’re a manager, your employees have the incentive to be less than truthful, because they want to be successful in their manager’s eyes.</p>

<p>The manager controls their pay, promotion, often their self-esteem (does the manager give them a nice word, or yell at them?). As a result of this, employees often want to show up well for their managers, and so one never gets a peer perspective on how people actually are working.</p>

<p>Managers may often have a biased view of an employee’s performance, which is why it is much better to also rely on their peer group around them and the people who see their work (such as their customers) as it is more representative.</p>

<h2 id="training-people-deliberate-practice-on-small-things">Training people (deliberate practice on small things):</h2>

<p>Once, it was an awful, awful, night. It rained, it thunder stormed, the wind was gusting strongly. A person driving to a party, heads past the driving course and sees a person from afar hitting golf balls – at 11 o’clock at night in the driving range! At the time the person had no idea who it was and goes out to the party.</p>

<p>Then he comes back at 3 in the morning and the same person is still out there, hitting balls, in the rain, in the middle of the night, in a thunder storm! So he goes up to him and says Mr, (who turns out to be Tiger Woods), this is crazy, why are you doing this? The person replies “It doesn’t rain that often in Northern California, so this is the one time I have to practice.”</p>

<p>The lesson here is that there is something to be said about the notion of deliberate, concentrated practice! The conventional view of learning and training and development is, I’m going to take a course on microeconomics and be an expert on microeconomics. The reality often is that we learn best when we focus on the smallest possible things. When we do deliberate practice around one small skill that is the constituent component of a much longer thing.</p>

<p>So in this case, it doesn’t make sense if you want to be a great golfer to just go out and play lots and lots of golf all the time, because sometimes its going to rain, and when it does you have to focus on that one very deliberate thing.</p>

<p>This gives you two things. One is, immediate repetition of that skill. Second, immediate feedback and course correction.</p>

<p>The way people learn best is by having those two things working together. So figure out what you want people to focus on, and practice that discrete skill. Deliberate, daily practice on small skills adds up to a large transformation.</p>

<h2 id="focus-on-people-and-culture">Focus on people and culture</h2>

<p>Try and measure what works and what doesn’t, and systematize it, so others can do it and so that you can also scale it.</p>

<p>People often worry about culture. (Most people like things to be nimble, fast, non-hierarchical, where they can get things done. They don’t like too much bureaucracy). So there is often always this notion that a company culture might be at the risk of being lost. It can actually be a very positive thing, because it becomes a healthy paranoia that can shape and drive a company forward.</p>

<p>In some industries, the histories of companies is not that deep. Some companies have risen quickly and plateaued, some have risen and fallen. What such companies have learned is that when they become more cost-focused, this can create a huge tipping point in the culture. Even the small signals given out can matter tremendously. Things like slamming a door, or whether a person leaves the garbage on the table after lunch, are signals that can quickly get internalized by others in the company. These are signals that shape everything for good or for ill!</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-paid-unfairly">What does it mean to be paid unfairly?</h2>

<p>Talent often doesn’t follow a normal distribution. It often follows instead a power law distribution. If you look at fields like politics, music, athletics, academic publishing and business, a normal distribution says you have some people at the top and some at the bottom, with most in the middle.</p>

<p>What actually ends up happening is that you have a much smaller number of people whose performance is supernormal, and their performance is way outside the average. An easy analogy is if you look at athletics: there are some sportsman who are way better than most (take Usain Bolt). These are people who are exceptional. Often, nobody looks at this and says, that’s weird, what a bizarre statistical anomaly. In such cases, the performance is directly observable and measurable (and celebrated) – to a large extent.</p>

<p>So you can often see this difference in performance across professions. The best people are often significantly better than average. Its true of both companies and individuals.</p>

<p>Now the question is what distribution should pay systems be? Normal, or wide exponential distributions? It’s an interesting but also sensitive question. Another important question is how does one justify such differences?</p>

<p>There are often two types of justice: distributive and procedural. We are often comfortable with either. Distributive justice is often about making pay transparent. Everyone can see where things are. The problem though with such a system is that NO one is happy, except for perhaps the very top person. Even the second highest person will probably be vexed because they wanted to be the top, and the person who got to the top may have wished they had been higher.</p>

<p>So instead, what you might need is procedural justice, where you can explain to people how the process works and why it is fair. To validate and test whether the outcomes are fair. People can often live with this as long the company has a fair process and as long as people understand and appreciate that it’s a fair process.</p>

<p>The other thing you need to do is repair the inequities that exist in society already, on hire. Pay differences between women and men, pay differences across countries. Should your pay be based on your job or your prior pay? Ultimately, you want to pay market rates, because the people you lose can often turn out to be your absolute best people, who generate the most value for you and your company!</p>

<h2 id="should-you-make-a-counter-offer-to-your-top-employees">Should you make a counter-offer to your top employees?</h2>

<p>This can sometimes have a toxic affect, if you are making an important HR decision on pay.</p>

<p>Competitors poaching for talent often call all the time. The very best people might not take calls at all, the next best people might take the call but not the interview, the next best person might go for the interview and say, well actually the company I work for is pretty good. Then you go down to the next person who returns and says I’ve got an offer. But then you have all these layers of people who did not go because they didn’t take the call. Part of the way you address this is by having wide payment distributions.</p>

<p>There may be deep strategic reasons however why you might want to make a counter offer. If you make it hard for companies to recruit out of you, the recruiters actually stop trying. Though you should be mindful about why you’re doing it because it can have a toxic and pernicious affect.</p>
