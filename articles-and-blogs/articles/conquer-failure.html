<p>Conquer and live life to the full, without fear of failure! Often, when you choose what to do, or not to do, because the world thinks about goals, because it thinks about success, and about failure, people want to do things that they’re going to be successful in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maybe you don’t want to run in a marathon, because you think if you participate, you’re going to end up in the lowest ten percent.</li>
  <li>Maybe you’re not going to take that challenging class elective because you might get a low grade in it</li>
  <li>Maybe you don’t want that job or role in a particular industry, because all your friends are going into something more lucrative than you, or because others may look at you disapprovingly - and this might make you feel unhappy, or like a failure, at least in terms of that dimension.</li>
</ul>

<p>What matters, however, and what is important to realise is that it is not so much about success, or failure, but how you feel about the very act of what you’re actually doing. Is the actual task you’re doing, the activity you’re engaged in, something you find truly fulfilling? Something intellectually engaging? Something that is self-empowering or self-actualising?</p>

<p>This is actually a very important thing to realise and can be incredibly freeing once you do!</p>

<p>Do you live boldly, and live and do what you do, what you like to do, what you love to do? Do you push yourself outside of your comfort zone and take risks? Try activities which, at the moment, scare you? Activities you have no past background, or skills, or competencies to be doing, but you just love to do them, because you’d really like to try and explore something new? And whether you fail, or whether you succeed, that doesn’t really matter, because what’s driving you is your passion for doing something in accordance with your values!</p>

<p>You might ask, well, how can something that others might find seemingly frivolous, and trivial, ever actually be fulfilling? Well, where the fulfilment might often come from is the fact that, such is the complexity of the activity, and so varied are the different styles that you and other people employ, that the number of potential endgames, and strategies, and game plans, is just infinite! No two times you engage in the activity are ever the same! Or, ever will be the same!</p>

<p>How can this be fulfilling? Well, it’s because the fulfilment comes from the realization that at the end of the game, there will always be a winner or loser. And that during the activity, the number of things that can happen is infinite! Anything might happen, and there might just be ONE play of such skill, or beauty, or coverage, that makes the entire activity worthwhile, regardless of what the outcome is. And it is this that gives you immense joy and pleasure, and is the reason why you do it!</p>

<p>The key point is that if you were to immerse yourself in an activity which involves the <strong><em>exchange of talents</em></strong> with other people, then that activity can become extremely worthwhile, regardless of what the outcome is. So go seek out activities which involve the <strong><em>exchange of talents</em></strong> with other people, which involve relationships, which involves sharing what you have, with your friends.</p>

<p>Many of the things that you actually pursue most passionately, may infact not even get you anything tangible! Why do organizers put so much work into organizing a trek, for example? Why do leadership veterans try to teach others about leadership skills? Why at all do people share work they’re never even paid for?</p>

<p>They’re not getting anything out of it, they’re not getting a check, a job, a bonus, they’re not getting a medal. But what they’re getting out of it is something far more!</p>

<p>They realise that if you live a life in terms of success, or failure, the problem with this is that whether you succeed, or whether you fail, is going to be down to luck most of the time. It could be that you try your hardest, but you’re just unlucky, because somebody else got that reward rather that you. And if how you feel - your sense of self-worth - is about whether you’ve succeeded or failed, then you’ll be unhappy, half the time, because half the time you will have had bad luck!</p>

<p>If, however, what drives you is not the final outcome, but the journey, the entirety of what you’re doing, then this is something where bad luck, even if it happens to you, is not something which is going to take away from your experience! Even the fact that somebody else loves the activity even more than you, is also clearly not going to take away from your happiness!</p>

<p>For example, when partaking in a team sport, I don’t just tell my teammates to go out and win a race. Why? Because whether they win the race or not, is going to be down too many factors outside their control. If, it’s a timed event we’re participating in, I don’t even tell them to go off with a certain target time, because whether they get that target time will depend on things such as the weather conditions!</p>

<p>What I tell them is the following: I tell them to have a feeling, that when they cross that finishing line, to feel that there is nothing more, at any point, they could have done to finish any faster or any better, be that through extra effort, or by sharpening their technique.</p>

<p>Why? Because if you just give everything that you have, with a huge passion, and you do what you’re doing without any fear of failure, then you’re always going to be succeeding, regardless of what the final outcome is!</p>

<p>So, always remember, conquer and live life without the fear of failure!</p>
