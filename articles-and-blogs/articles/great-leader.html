<h2 id="1-passion">1. Passion</h2>

<p>Most people <em>can</em> lead. But do they <em>want</em> to lead?</p>

<p>When you bring someone into your team, you want someone who’s not only capable of leading your team into victory but who’s motivated to do so!</p>

<p>A willingness to take control when the going gets tough is a mark of a great leader. It shows a passion, bravery and commitment to lead, no matter what is thrown at them.</p>

<h2 id="2-conflict-resolution">2. Conflict Resolution</h2>

<p>All great leaders should be able to resolve conflicts quickly, fairly and efficiently.</p>

<p>If there is tension in the office, then that is something that can quickly get out of control and affect the culture of a team, impacting an employee’s engagement and productivity.</p>

<p>Great leaders will try to quell awkward situations before they go too far. They will peacemakers, in the office, not slave drivers.</p>

<h2 id="3-adaptability">3. Adaptability</h2>

<p>Leaders should be able to cope with a variety of tasks and different kinds of people.</p>

<p>Great leaders should be able to adapt in the face of unforeseen circumstances. They will want to relish different challenges.</p>

<p>Great leaders will face setbacks head on and work with whatever resources they have to come up with a solution, and learn and reflect along the way.</p>

<h2 id="4-creativity">4. Creativity.</h2>

<p>In an ideal world, you want all your staff will be brimming with creativity, inspiration and innovation!</p>

<p>Creative leaders will bring to the table ideas that perhaps you may have overlooked, and which will inspire others in your team to do the same!</p>

<p>Leaders will recognise great ideas when they’re brought to the table and get behind them 100%!</p>

<p>Creative leaders will be are eager to always try out new things - but still exhibit a clear decision-making process, without rushing too fast into things.</p>

<p>Creative leaders will also be able to think on their feet and answer sensibly.</p>

<h2 id="5-negotiation">5. Negotiation.</h2>

<p>A good leader will also most likely be a good negotiator - as chances are, most of their job will be persuasion of some kind - at staff, customers or suppliers.</p>

<p>Good leaders should be able to negotiate without causing conflict or upsetting anyone.</p>

<p>Good leaders won’t resort to threats or intimidation. Instead, they will show fairness, empathy, critical reasoning and confidence!</p>

<p>They will be able to assess their opponent’s point of view and use it to convince them and try to keep everyone happy!</p>

<h2 id="6-decision-making">6. Decision Making.</h2>

<p>Great leaders should have the ability to make rational decisions and stick by them.</p>

<p>Everyone makes mistakes; no one in this galaxy is perfect - however, leaders in particular will have strong, structured decision-making processes in their minds. They will be level headed and commercially minded!</p>

<p>Great leaders will also have given thought to the consequences of certain actions. They will have their own unique way of making a decision, taking as much as they can into consideration.</p>

<p>They will take rationale calculated, thought through, risks. They will not gamble!</p>

<h2 id="7-people-management">7. People Management.</h2>

<p>A great leader will be able to supervise and manage other employees confidently and effectively.</p>

<p>They will be inspire and motivate their good staff members to develop, grow, and challenge themselves. But they will also know how to deal with the troublemakers and under-performers.</p>

<p>(Leading is no bed of roses!)</p>

<p>That said, Leaders will not be too quick to judge struggling staff without asking questions. They will, too, have experience and a passion for developing other employees.</p>

<p>Leaders will understand that training others is a really important part of building a close-knit and successful team!</p>

<p>A good leader will also know, though, when it’s time to get tough!</p>

<h2 id="other-desirable-leadership-traits">Other desirable Leadership traits</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A leader should be likable</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A leader should be able to lead others</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A leader should be able to fit in!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A leader should not be arrogant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A leader should not cause (too much!) friction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A leader should be guided by a clear conscience.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>People are a lot more likely to follow and be inspired by leaders they actually like and trust!</p>

<h2 id="how-is-a-leader-different-from-the-rest">How is a leader different from the rest?</h2>

<p>Everyone claims to be a hard worker, good communicator, and team player!</p>

<p>But how many are a great <em>problem-solvers</em>, <em>game-changers</em>, and <em>leaders</em> in their industry?</p>

<p>Are you a hard worker? Probably already quite common place in the office? Maybe you work hard, but helping others work fewer hours, by helping them do their job better, or making their jobs easier, is also a sign of great leadership!</p>

<p>Lots of people speak lots of languages. Lots of people are great communicators. This does not though just mean speaking well. This also means listening. Do you hear what others don’t? Do you understand quickly? Can you understand what people are trying to tell you through other clues (body language, for example?). Leaders should!</p>

<p>Being a good team player is expected. But what does this really mean? Can you get along with everyone? That’s not hard to do if you’re a nice person. Do you think you’re pulling your weight in the office? Again, expected. Perhaps a leader should think about what they have done that goes above and beyond? Leaders can often save a team from a disaster and help them meet a seemingly impossible goal!</p>

<h2 id="other-people-should-like-working-for-leaders">Other people should like working for Leaders!</h2>

<p>Leaders should not have complaints about the way things have gone or could have been.</p>

<p>Leaders should also have great relationships in all their postings, and assignments, with all of their work colleagues.</p>

<p>If they are to be disliked — it should only be temporary — for, only those days, when they might want to challenge their staff to push themselves, and perform better…</p>

<p>Sometimes, even leaders have to make unpopular decisions that are for the larger good of their organisation, its mission, vision, and true cause.</p>

<h2 id="finally">Finally…</h2>

<p>A leader’s strength should be to inspire. To want to <strong><em>lead by example</em></strong>, and turn low performing teams into high performing ones! It’s not about the leader, it never is! It is about his or her team!</p>

<p>Leaders will also want to appreciate the importance of Technology, and be able to see all the good that it can bring to the world (business, society, our communities, and our wider way of life – in how we interact, trade, communicate, and do great things for each other!)</p>
