<h2 id="does-success-come-from-luck-or-skill">Does success come from luck or skill?</h2>

<p>The most contentious question in business is whether success comes from luck or skill. The phenomenon of serial entrepreneurship seems to call into question our tendency to explain success as a product of chance. Hundreds of people have started multiple million-dollar businesses. If success was mostly a matter of luck, these kinds of Entrepreneurs (Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, Steve Jobs) probably wouldn’t exist.</p>

<p>It’s true that successful people already have an easier time doing new things, whether due to their wealth, networks, or experiences. But its all too easy to dismiss anyone who claims to have succeeded according to a plan!</p>

<p>Is there a way to settle this debate successfully? Unfortunately, not, because companies are not experiments! Every company starts in unique circumstances, and every company starts only once. Statistics doesn’t work when the sample size is only one!</p>

<h2 id="can-you-control-your-future">Can you control your future?</h2>

<p>You can expect the future to take a definite form, or you can treat it as hazily uncertain. If you treat the future definite, then it makes sense to understand it in advance and try to shape it. If you expect an indefinite future, ruled by randomness, you’ll give up on trying to master it.</p>

<p>Society’s indefinite attitudes towards the future explain what’s most dysfunctional in our world today. Process trumps substance! People who lack concrete plans to carry out, use formal rules to assemble a portfolio of options. Many students who go to college having spent over a decade curating a bewilderingly diverse resume to prepare for a completely unknowable future: come what may – he or she is ready! – but for nothing in particular!</p>

<p>A definite attitude favours firm convictions. Instead of pursuing a many-sided mediocrity, and calling it “<em>well roundedness</em>” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it! Instead of working tirelessly to make him or herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive – to be a monopoly of one!</p>

<p>One can also expect the future to get better or worse than the present. Optimists welcome the future, pessimists fear it. Combining these possibilities yields the following four views.</p>

<h2 id="indefinite-pessimism">Indefinite Pessimism</h2>

<p>Every culture has a decline from some golden age. Today pessimism still dominates large parts of the world. An indefinite pessimist looks out to a bleak future, and has no idea what to do about it.</p>

<p>This describes Europe since the early 1970s, when the continent succumbed to an undirected bureaucratic drift. Today, the whole of the Eurozone is in a slow-motion crisis, and nobody is in charge.</p>

<p>(According to most American’s…) The European Bank doesn’t stand for anything but improvisation: The U.S. Treasury prints, “<em>In God We Trust</em>” on the dollar. The ECB might as well print “<em>Kick the Can Down the Road</em>” on the euro.</p>

<p>Europeans just act on events as they happen, and then hope things don’t get worse. They can’t know when the future will go into decline, so all he can do is wait for it to happen, so he might as well eat, drink, and be merry in the meantime. Hence Europe’s famous vacation mania.</p>

<h2 id="definite-pessimism">Definite Pessimism</h2>

<p>A definite pessimist believes the future can be known, and since it is bleak, he must prepare for it. Perhaps, surprisingly, China is the most definitely pessimistic place on the planet. When the world sees the Chinese economy grow ferociously fast (10% per year since 2000), it imagines a confident country mastering its future!</p>

<p>From China’s view point, economic growth could not come fast enough! Every country in the world is afraid China is going to take over the world; China is the only country afraid that it won’t.</p>

<p>China can grow so fast, only because it’s starting base is so low. The easiest way for China to grow is to relentless copy what has worked in the West: executing definite plans to burn more coal, build more factories and skyscrapers. But with a huge population pushing resource prices higher, there’s no way Chinese living standards can actually catch up those of the richest countries, and the Chinese know it.</p>

<p>Outsiders are attracted by the great fortunes being made in China, but they pay less attention to the wealthy Chinese trying hard to get their money out of the country. Every class of people in China take the future deadly seriously!</p>

<h2 id="definite-optimism">Definite Optimism</h2>

<p>To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present, but only if he plans and works to make it better. From the 17th century through to the 1950s and ‘60s optimists led the Western world. Scientists, engineers, doctors and business-men made the world richer, healthier, and more long lived than previously imaginable.</p>

<p>Each generation’s inventors and visionaries surpassed their predecessors. In 1869 the Suez Canal saved Eurasian shipping traffic from rounding the Cape of Good Hope. The Empire State Building was started in 1929 and finished in 1931. The Golden Gate Bridge was started in 1933 and completed in 1937.</p>

<p>Definite planning even went beyond this planet: NASA’s Apollo Program began in 1961 and put 12 men on the moon before it finished in 1972.</p>

<h2 id="indefinite-optimism">Indefinite Optimism</h2>

<p>After a brief pessimistic phase in the 1970’s, indefinite optimism has dominated American thinking ever since 1982, when the long bull market began and finance began to eclipse engineering as a way to approach the future.</p>

<p>To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn’t know exactly how, so he won’t make any specific plans. He expects profits from the future but sees no reason to design it concretely.</p>

<p>Instead of working years to build a new product, indefinite optimists re-arrange old already invented ones. Bankers make money by re-arranging the capital structures of already existing companies. Lawyers resolve disputes over old things, or help people structure their affairs. Private Equity investors and Management Consultants don’t start new businesses; they squeeze extra efficiency from old ones with incessant procedural optimizations.</p>

<p>It’s no surprize then that a disproportionately large number of us have become optionality chasers, hell-bent on process-oriented careers that promises to “<em>keep options</em>” open.</p>

<p>Ever since 1945 technological advance has seemed to accelerate automatically. Things got better for the first 18 years of your life and it had nothing to do with you. The Baby Boom generation grew up with great expectations but few specific plans on how to fulfil them.</p>

<p>When technological progress stalled in the 1970s, increasing income inequality rescued the most elite Boomers. Every year automatically got better for the rich and successful. Boomers who shape public opinion today see little reason to question their naïve optimism. Since tracked careers worked for them, they can’t imagine that they won’t work for their kids too!</p>

<h2 id="do-we-live-in-an-indefinitely-optimistic-world">Do we live in an indefinitely optimistic world?</h2>

<h2 id="indefinite-finance">Indefinite Finance</h2>

<p>While a definitely optimistic future would need engineers to design underwater cities and settlements in space, an indefinitely optimistic future calls for more bankers and lawyers.</p>

<p>Finance epitomizes indefinite thinking because it’s the only way to make money when you have no idea how to create wealth. If they don’t go to law school, they’ll go to Wall Street, precisely because they have no real plan for their careers.</p>

<p>Everything inside finance is indefinite. It’s still optimistic – you wouldn’t play the markets if you expected to lose – but the fundamental tenet of the market is that it is random; you can’t know anything specific or substantive; diversification becomes extremely important.</p>

<p>Its indefiniteness is bizarre. Think about what happens when successful entrepreneurs sell their company. What do they do with the money? In a financialized world it unfolds like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The founders don’t know what to do with it, so they give it to a large bank</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The bankers don’t know what to do with it, so they diversify by spreading it across a portfolio of institutional investors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Institutional investors don’t know what to do with their managed capital, so they diversify by amassing a portfolio of stocks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Companies try to increase their share price by generating cash flows. If they do, they issue dividends, or buy back shares and the cycle repeats!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>At no point in the chain does anybody know what to do with the money in the real economy. But in an indefinite world, people actually prefer unlimited optionality; money itself is more valuable than anything you could possibly do with it. Only in a definite future is money a means to an end, not the end itself.</p>

<h2 id="indefinite-life">Indefinite Life</h2>

<p>Our ancestors sought to understand and extend the human lifespan. In the 16th century, conquistadors searched the jungles of Florida for the Fountain of Youth. Francis Bacon wrote that “<em>the prolongation of life</em>” should be considered its own branch of medicine – and the noblest. In the 1660s, Robert Boyle placed life extension (along with the “<em>Recovery of Youth</em>”) atop his famous wish list for the future of science. Whether through geographic exploration or laboratory research, the best minds of the Renaissance thought of death as something to defeat.</p>

<p>We haven’t yet uncovered the secrets of life, but insurers and statisticians in the 19th century successfully revealed a secret about death that still governs our thinking today: they discovered how to reduce it to a mathematical probability. “<em>Life tables</em>” tell us our chances of dying in a particular year, something previous generations didn’t know. However, in exchange for better insurance contracts we seem to have given up the search for secrets about longevity.</p>

<p>Probabilistic attitudes have come to shape the agenda of biology itself. In 1928, Scottish Alchemist Alexander Fleming found that a mysterious antibacterial fungus had grown on a petri dish that he’d forgotten to cover in his laboratory: he discovered penicillin by accident. Modern day drug discovery aims to amplify Fleming’s serendipitous circumstances a million-fold: pharmaceutical companies search through combinations of molecular compounds, hoping to find a hit.</p>

<p>But it’s not working as well as it used to. Despite dramatic advances, in recent decades technology has not met the expectations of investors – or patients. Eroom’s law – that’s Moore’s law backwards – observes that the number of drugs approved per billion dollars spent on R&amp;D has halved every nine years since 1950. Since information technology advanced faster than ever in those same years, the big question for biotech today is will we ever see similar progress?</p>

<p>Biotech start-ups are an extreme example of indefinite thinking. Researchers experiment with things that just might work, instead of refining definite theories about how the body’s systems operate. Biologists say they need to work this way because the underlying biology is hard. According to them IT start-ups work because humans have created computers ourselves and designed them to reliably obey our commands. Bio-tech is difficult because we didn’t design our own bodies, and the more we learn about them, the more complex they turn out to be. This is a point!</p>

<p>But today it’s possible to wonder whether the genuine difficulty of biology has become an excuse for biotech’s indefinite approach to business in general. Most of the people involved expect some things to work eventually, but few want to commit to a specific company with the level of intensity necessary for success. It’s easy for libertarians to claim that heavy regulation holds biotech back – and it does - but indefinite optimism may pose an even greater challenge for the future of biotech.</p>

<h2 id="does-indefinite-optimism-even-work">Does indefinite optimism even work?</h2>

<p>It’s easy to see the other views of the future work. Definite optimism works when you build the future you envision. Definite pessimism works by building what can be copied without expecting anything new. Indefinite pessimism works because it’s self-fulfilling. If you’re a slacker with low expectations – they’ll probably be met. Indefinite optimism however seems inherently unstable: how can the future get better if no one plans for it?</p>

<p>Actually, most people in the world have already heard the answer to this question: progress without definite planning is what we call “<em>evolution</em>”. Darwin himself wrote that life tends to “<em>progress</em>” without anyone intending it. Every living thing is just some random iteration of some other organism, and the best iterations win.</p>

<p>Darwin’s theories explain the origins of the dinosaurs, but can it be extended to domains that are far removed? Just as Newtonian physics cannot explain black holes or the Big Bang, it’s not clear how Darwinian should explain how to build a better society or how to create a new business out of nothing.</p>

<p>Even in Engineering driven Silicon Valley, buzzwords of the moment call for building the lean “<em>start-up</em>” that can “<em>evolve</em>” and “<em>adapt</em>” to an ever changing environment.</p>

<p>But leanness is a methodology, not a goal. Making small changes to a thing that already exists might lead you to a local maximum, but it won’t help you find a global maximum.</p>

<p>A company is the strangest place of all for an indefinite optimist: why should you expect your own business to succeed without a plan to make it happen? Darwinism may be a fine theory in other context, but in start-ups, intelligent design works best.</p>

<h2 id="the-return-of-design">The return of design</h2>

<p>What would it mean to prioritize design over choice? Today, good design, is an aesthetic imperative, and everyone from slackers to yuppies carefully “<em>curate</em>” their outward appearance.</p>

<p>It’s true that every great entrepreneur is first and foremost a great designer. Anyone who has held an iDevice or smoothly machined MacBook has felt the result of Steve Job’s obsession with visual and experiential perfection.</p>

<p>But the most important lesson to learn from Steve Jobs was not aesthetics, it was how to build a great business. Apple invested and executed definite multi-year plans to create new products and distribute them effectively.</p>

<p>Forget “<em>minimal viable product</em>” – ever since he started Apple in 1976, he saw that you could change the world through careful planning, not by listening to focus groups or copying other people’s success.</p>

<p>Long term planning is often under-estimated by our indefinite short term world. When the first iPod was released in October 2001, industry analyst’s couldn’t see much more than a “<em>nice feature to have</em>” that “<em>doesn’t make any difference to the rest of the world</em>”. Jobs planned the iPod to be the first in a new generation of portable post-PC devices, but the secret was invisible to most people. One look at the company’s stock price shows the harvest of this multi-year plan.</p>

<p>The power of planning explains the difficulty of valuing private companies. When a big company makes an offer to acquire a successful start-up, it almost always offers too much or too little: founders only sell when they have no concrete visions for the future of the company, in which case the acquirer probably overpaid. And definite founders with robust plans don’t sell, which means the offer wasn’t high enough.</p>

<p>When Yahoo! offered to buy Facebook for $1 billion in July 2006, Mark Zuckerberg walked into the Board meeting and announced: “<em>Okay guys, this is just a formality, it shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes. We’re obvious not going to sell here</em>”. Mark saw where he could take the company, and Yahoo! didn’t. A business with a definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random.</p>

<h2 id="so-are-you-a-lottery-ticket">So are you a lottery ticket?</h2>

<p>This depends on whether we can find our way back to a definite future, and modern developed countries need nothing short of a cultural revolution to do it.</p>

<p>It will require an overhaul of philosophy departments, and for the pollsters to be driven from politics. But many are set in their ways to say nothing of the politicians. It’s extremely hard to make changes in those fields, even with brains and good intentions.</p>

<p>A start-up is probably the largest endeavour over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance! So no, you are not a lottery ticket!</p>
