Sachin Tandon
</span>
</h3>

  <section class="about-flex">
    <div class="left">
      <div class="white">

        <p>Sachin Tandon works to help businesses in the “<em><b>Media &amp; Entertainment</b></em>” and “<em><b>Technology &amp; Engineering</b></em>” sectors grow, prosper, and thrive! He does this currently by applying Science &amp; Engineering, and other tools and technologies (e.g. in the fields of <em>Data Engineering</em>, <em>Data Analytics</em>, <em>Data Science</em>, <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>, <em>etc.</em>) so that the businesses he works with can get the insight they need to make better business decisions!</p>

        <p>Sachin has been fortunate enough in his 15+ year career to date, to have worked with a wide range of people, across a variety of countries, including the U.K., U.S.A., India, Middle East, and Japan.</p>

        <p>In fact, it was after learning Japanese at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, during his Undergraduate Master’s Degree, that Sachin, in 2007, flew to Tokyo to work for the Technology company, Hitachi Digital (to solve a challenging Manufacturing Engineering problem). It was here, in the bussling Electronics District of Tokyo, Akihabara, when he also bought his first Digital S.L.R. Camera, so he could continue to pursue his interest in Creative Photography, whilst he travelled the country to deepen his culturing understanding of Japanese food, history, heritage and tradition.</p>

        <p>After a degree in <em>Engineering</em> from the University of Cambridge, U.K (where Sachin was also President for 4 years of the College Film Society, Caius Films), and from M.I.T. in Boston, the U.S.A., Sachin then set out to learn about <em>Business &amp; Finance</em>, working early on in his career for the Professional Services firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers (P.w.C.), in London. There, as he worked for various clients by day, he also studied to become a Qualified Accountant, and after 3 years of much graft, successfully became a Chartered Accountant!</p>

        <p>After his early years in Finance, Sachin then went on to pursue a self-funded M.B.A., from Manchester Business School, to learn more broadly about business - especially of areas that were quite new to him, such as: <em>Marketing</em>, <em>Human Resources</em>, <em>Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship</em>, <em>Digital Commerce</em>, and <em>Business Strategy</em>, and so he could get a much deeper exposure to other areas in <em>Finance</em> such as: <em>Corporate Finance</em>, <em>Mergers &amp; Acquisitions</em>, and <em>Venture Capital</em>. It was an experience that greatly widened his perspective of business, and one that also allowed him to further develop his Management and Leadership skills.</p>

        <p>After completing his M.B.A., Sachin then set up his venture: StarTech Enterprises - a Ltd Co. through which he works passionately(!) to help “<em><b>Media & Entertainment</b></em>” and “<em><b>Technology & Engineering</b></em>” companies to develop and grow themselves, so they can continually meet (and exceed!) their employee and customer needs. He does this currently by providing input and challenge to a variety of organisations, and the individuals that work within them, so they can pilot and test out new ideas, products, and technologies - and in doing so, solve their most challenging problems, successfully transform themselves, and find new ways to grow!</p>

        <p>Sachin has, over his career so far, been able to work for a wide range of companies, including: <span style="color:#0463fe;"><em>Apple (Orignal Productions)</em>, <em>Warner Media/Warner Brothers</em>, <em>B.B.C. Media</em>, <em>Hitachi Digital</em>, <em>W.P.P. (Wunderman Thompson, Hogarth, Geometry)</em>, <em>The Omnicom Media Group (Portland Communications)</em>, <em>King Digital Entertainment</em>, and <em>Jaguar Land Rover</em></span> - in the <strong><em>Media &amp; Entertainment</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Technology &amp; Engineering</em></strong> sectors, to: <span style="color:#0463fe;"><em>Diageo Corporate Ventures</em>, <em>The Landmark Group</em>, <em>Carrefour</em>, <em>Happy Ratio</em>, and <em>J. L. Rohatgi Memorial Eye Hospital</em></span> - in the <strong><em>Retail</em></strong>, <strong><em>Food &amp; Drink</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Medical</em></strong> sectors.</p>

        <p>In doing so, Sachin has been able to accumulate a breadth of experience and knowledge, from different perspectives, across the Media, Technology, Marketing, Retail, Finance, Education, and Travel industries.</p>

        <p>Having established an extensive network of contacts, Sachin’s primary focus now is on giving his clients, (especially those in the Media & Entertainment, and Technology & Engineering sectors), the best possible ideas and insights he can, through practical and lasting solutions that will allow them to continue to flourish and expand!</p>

Outside Interests

  <section class="about-flex">
    <div class="left">
      <div class="white">

        <p>When he is not helping “<em><b>Media &amp; Entertainment</b></em>” and “<em><b>Technology &amp; Engineering</b></em>” companies become better at what they do, Sachin continues to lead a bright and colorful life. This includes enjoying his recent travels to remote parts of Southern Asia, the Far East, Southern Africa, Western, and Eastern Europe - using the opportunity to absorb new cultures, meet new people, and really savour the diversity of life!</p>

        <p>When not working, you can probably find him playing tennis, watching cricket, Formula 1 motor sport, or following the progress of his favourite football team - Manchester United (His parents lived not very far from Old Trafford, before he was born!)</p>

        <p>He continues to strongly pursue his passions for film, media, entertainment, engineering, and technology, reading books on the topic (like: <span style="color:#E7231F;"><em>The Wired</em>, <em>M.I.T. Tech Review</em>, <em>Total Film Magazine</em>, and <em>National Geographic</em> !</span>), whilst also celebrating the remarkable things other people have done in the field - in addition - to participating in a wide range of cultural and gastronomic activities… when he gets the time!</p>

        <p>So, life, all round, is very busy!</p>
